The Chairman / Chief Executives of
All Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding RRBs)

Dear Sir / Madam,

Working Group on Information Security, Electronic Banking, Technology
Risk  Management
of
recommendations

Implementation

Frauds-

Cyber

and

As you are aware, following the announcement in the April 2010 Monetary Policy
Statement,  the  Working  Group  on  Information  Security,  Electronic  Banking,
Technology  Risk  Management  and  Cyber  Frauds  was  constituted,  under  the
Chairmanship  of  Shri  G.  Gopalakrishna,  Executive  Director,  RBI.  The  Group
examined  various  issues  arising  out  of  the  use  of  Information  Technology  in
banks  and  made  its  recommendations  in  nine  broad  areas.  These  areas  are  IT
Governance,  Information  Security,  IS  Audit,  IT  Operations,  IT  Services
Outsourcing,  Cyber  Fraud,  Business  Continuity  Planning,  Customer
Awareness  programmes  and  Legal  aspects.  The  report  was  placed  on  the
RBI  website  on  January  21,  2011.  Subsequently,  on  February  1,  2011,  views/
comments  of  all  stake-holders  and  the  public  at  large  on  the  Report  were
invited.  After  taking  into  account  various  responses,  final  guidelines  in  the
respective  areas  as  mentioned  above  are  now  being  issued  to  banks  for
implementation.  The  guidelines  are  enclosed  herewith  for  implementation  by
banks.

(b)  The  guidelines  are  not  “one-size-fits-all”  and  the  implementation  of  these
recommendations need to be risk based and commensurate with the nature and
scope of activities engaged by banks and the technology environment prevalent
in the bank and the support rendered by technology to the business processes.
Banks  with  extensive  leverage  of  technology  to  support  business  processes
would be expected to implement all the stipulations outlined in the circular. For
example,  banks  which  do  not  offer  transactional  facilities  in  internet  banking
would not be required to implement specific measures for transactional internet
banking  facility  outlined  in  the  guidelines.  Further,  various  instructions  in  “IT
operations”  chapter  like  detailed  configuration  management  practices  may  not
be  necessary  for  banks  that  do  not  develop  or  maintain  critical  applications

internally,  though  such  practices  may  be  expected  from  the  external  vendor
providing such services.

(c)  The  Group  had  endeavored  to  generate  self-contained  and  comprehensive
guidelines.  This  has  resulted  in  reiteration  of  certain  guidelines  already
prescribed by RBI, for example, in certain areas relating to information security,
outsourcing,  BCP  and  IS  Audit.  However,  there  are  certain  guidelines  like  the
checklist  for  computer  audit  prescribed  in  the  year  2002  which  on  the  whole
cannot  be  ignored  since  the  nature  of  coverage  is  different.  In  the  event  of  a
direct conflict with an earlier guideline, the new guideline would be the basis for
implementation  by  banks.  Else,  the  relevant  guidelines  prescribed  earlier  would
be  an  adjunct  to  the  present  guidelines  issued  herewith.  It  would  be  the
endeavor  of  RBI  to  develop  the  enclosed  guidelines  as  a  Master  Circular
incorporating  relevant  old  and  new  circulars  on  related  subject  areas  in  due
course.  In  the  event  of  any  further  clarifications  in  the  matter,  banks  may
approach RBI for further guidance.

(d)  The  Group’s  report  was  largely  technology  neutral  except  in  exceptional
circumstances  where  a  specific  technology/methodology  may  be  suggested  due
to legal reasons or for enhanced security or for illustrative purpose. It is clarified
required,  banks  may  consider  any  other
that  except  where
equivalent/better  and
technology/methodology  based  on  new
developments after carrying out a diligent evaluation exercise.

legally

robust

(e) Banks may have already implemented or implementing some or many of the
requirements  indicated  in  the  circular.  In  order  to  provide  focused  project
oriented  approach  towards  implementation  of  guidelines,  banks  would  be
required  to  conduct  a  formal  gap  analysis  between  their  current  status  and
stipulations as laid out in the circular and put in place a time-bound action plan
to  address  the  gap  and  comply  with  the  guidelines.  However,  banks  need  to
ensure  implementation  of  basic  organizational  framework  and  put  in  place
policies  and  procedures  which  do  not  require  extensive  budgetary  support,
infrastructural  or  technology  changes,  by  October  31,  2011.  The  rest  of  the
guidelines  need  to  be  implemented  within  period  of  one  year  unless  a  longer
time-frame is indicated in the circular. There are also a few provisions which are
recommendatory in nature, implementations of which are left to the discretion of
banks.

(f) Given the fact the guidelines are fundamentally expected to enhance safety,
security,  efficiency  in  banking  processes  leading  to  benefits  for  banks  and  their
customers,  the  progress  in  implementation  of  recommendations  may  be
monitored  by  the  top  management  on  an  ongoing  basis  and  a  review  of  the
implementation status may be put up to the Board at quarterly intervals. Banks
may also incorporate in their Annual Report from 2011-12 onwards broadly the
measures taken in respect of various subject areas indicated in these guidelines.

(g)  The measures suggested for implementation cannot be static. Banks need to
pro-actively  create/fine-tune/modify  their  policies,  procedures  and  technologies
based on new developments and emerging concerns.

(h)    Reserve  Bank  of  India  would  review  the  progress  in  implementation  of  the
guidelines  in  its  Quarterly  Discussions  with  banks  and  would  examine
comprehensively the efficacy of implementation of the guidelines commensurate
with nature and scope of operations of individual banks from the next AFI cycle
(for the period 2011-12) onwards.

(i) Please acknowledge receipt.

Yours faithfully,

      Sd/-

Chapter 1: IT GOVERNANCE

Introduction:

Corporate Governance constitutes the accountability framework of a bank. IT Governance is
an integral part of it. It involves leadership support, organizational structure and processes to
ensure that a bank’s IT sustains and extends business strategies and objectives. Effective IT
Governance is the responsibility of the Board of Directors and Executive Management.

Access  to  reliable  information  has  become  an  indispensable  component  of  conducting
business, indeed, in a growing number of banks, information is business.

Today, almost every commercial bank branch is at some stage of technology adoption: core
banking  solution  (CBS),  or  alternate  delivery  channels  such  as  internet  banking,  mobile
banking, phone banking and ATMs.

GUIDANCE FOR BANKS

a)  Roles and Responsibilities and Organizational Framework:

Well-defined  roles  and  responsibilities  of  Board  and  Senior  Management  are  critical,  while
implementing IT Governance. Clearly-defined roles enable effective project control. People,
when they are aware of others' expectations from them, are able to complete work on time,
within budget and to the expected level of quality.

IT Governance Stakeholders include:

IT Strategy Committees

•  Board of Directors
•
•  CEOs
•  Business Executives
•  CIOs
•

IT  Steering  Committees  (operating  at  an  executive  level  and  focusing  on  priority
setting, resource allocation and project tracking)

•  Chief Risk Officer
•  Risk Committees

b)  Organisation Structure:

i).  Expertise  at  the  Board  Level:  IT  Strategy  Committees  should  have  some  form  of
participation at the Board level. This is to ensure that as part of the Corporate Governance
initiatives, IT Governance is also addressed, so as to advice on strategic direction on IT and
to review IT investments on Board's behalf.

ii).  Qualified  and  Independent  IT  Strategy  Committee:  A  qualified  and  an  independent  IT
Strategy Committee should be set up with a minimum of two directors as members, one of
whom  should  be  an  independent  director.  IT  Strategy  Committee  members  should  be
technically  competent.  At  least  one  member  should  have  substantial  IT  expertise  in
managing technology.

P a g e  | 3

(Explanation1: Technically competent herein will mean the ability to understand and evaluate
technology systems.

Explanation  2: A  member  will  be  considered  to  have  “substantial  IT  expertise”  if  he  has  a
minimum  of  seven  years  of  experience  in  managing  IT  systems  and/or  leading/guiding
technology  initiatives/projects.  Such  a  member  should  also  have  an  understanding  of
banking processes at a broader level and of the impact of IT on such processes. If not, then
the member should be trained on these aspects.)

iii). Chairman of an IT Strategy Committee shall be an independent director.  Also, the CIO
should  be  a  part  of  this  committee,  who  should  be  present  at  Board  meetings  to  help  IT
strategy  align  with  business  goals.  The  IT  Strategy  Committee  should  meet  at  appropriate
frequency as and when needed (at least four times in a year) and not more than four months
should elapse between two meetings.

iv).  Powers  of  IT  Strategy  Committee:  It  is  recommended  that  the  committee  should  have
following powers:

•  Perform  oversight  functions  over  the  IT  Steering  Committee  (at  a  senior

management level)
•
Investigate activities within this scope
•  Seek information from any employee
•  Obtain outside legal or professional advice

involving  IT  strategy,  value  delivery,  risk  management,  IT  resource  and  performance
management.

Business Unit Level:

IT Steering Committee:

An  IT  Steering  Committee  needs  to  be  created  with  representatives  from  the  IT,  HR,  legal
and  business  sectors.  Its  role  is  to  assist  the  Executive  Management  in  implementing  IT
strategy  that  has  been  approved  by  the  Board.  It  includes  prioritization  of  IT-enabled
investment, reviewing the status of projects (including, resource conflict), monitoring service
levels and improvements, IT service delivery and projects. The committee should focus on
implementation. Its functions inter-alia include:

•  Defining project priorities and assessing strategic fit for IT proposals
•  Performing portfolio reviews for continuing strategic relevance

IT Line Management and Business Unit Management

Specific  roles  of  IT  Line  Management  and  Business  Unit  Management,  with  respect  to
technology, may vary depending upon the bank’s approach to risk management and policy
enforcement – either a centralized or a decentralized strategy.

d)  IT Organizational Structure:

The IT organizational structure should be commensurate with the size, scale and nature of
business  activities  carried  out  by  the  bank  and  the  underlying  support  provided  by
information  systems  for  the  business  functions.  The  broad  areas  or  functions  that  can  be
considered  for  IT  organizational  structure  will  include  technology  and  development,  IT
operations,  IT  assurance  and  supplier  and  resource  management,  each  of  which  may  be
headed by suitably experienced and trained senior officials (preferably not less than the rank
of AGM).

Illustrative functions of the various divisions may include:

−  Technology:  All

solutions (developed in-house or outsourced)

−

−

(servers,  operating  systems,  databases,
IT  Operations:  All
applications  and  help  desks),  such  as  managing  IT  Infrastructure  (facilities,  data
centres, networks and telecommunication), high availability and reliability of systems,
managing outsourced IT operations and services

IT  operations

IT  Assurance  Function:  All  quality,  risk  and  compliance  management  initiatives
within  the  IT  vertical  such  as  performance  or  conformance  metrics,  reports,
dashboards,  internal  user  feedback  and  analysis,  monitoring  IT  projects,  interaction
with audit, risk and compliance functions within a bank

Critical Components of IT Governance Framework:

The  basic  principles  of  value  delivery,  IT  Risk  Management,  IT  resource  management
(including IT project management) and performance management   must form the basis of
governance  framework.  One  of  the  well-known  international  frameworks  in  achieving
effective  control  over  IT  and  related  risks  is  the  “Control  Objectives  for  Information
Technology”(COBIT) that is issued by Information Technology Governance Institute (ITGI).
The framework provides five focus areas for IT Governance. The first two concepts namely
Value delivery and IT risk management are outcomes, while the remaining three are drivers:
IT  strategic  alignment,  IT  resource  management  and  performance  measurement  (refer
Chapter  1  of  the  Working  Group  Report).  IT  Governance  has  a  continuous  life-cycle.  It's  a
process  in  which  IT  strategy  drives  the  processes,  using  resources  necessary  to  execute
responsibilities.  Given  the  criticality  of  the  IT,  banks  may  follow  relevant  aspects  of  such
prudential governance standards that  have found acceptability in the industry.

P a g e  | 6

Focus Areas for IT Governance:

IT Governance entails number of activities for the Board and Senior Management, such as
becoming  aware  of  role  and  impact  of  IT  on  a  bank:  assigning  responsibilities,  defining
constraints  within  which  to  operate,  measuring  performance,  managing  risk  and  obtaining
assurance.

Recommendations, Actions on IT Governance practices:

Before  adopting  these,  banks  are  required  to  evaluate  their  nature  and  scope  of  activities
and the current level of leverage of IT and related controls.

1.  Policies and Procedures:

(a)  The  bank  needs  to  have  IT-related  strategy  and  policies  that  covers  areas

such as:
•  Existing  and  proposed  hardware  and  networking  architecture  for  a  bank

and its rationale

•  Broad  strategy  for  procurement  of  hardware  and  software  solutions,

vendor development and management

•  Standards

for  hardware  or  software  prescribed  by

the  proposed

architecture

•  Strategy for outsourcing, in-sourcing, procuring off-the-shelf software, and

in-house development
IT Department’s Organizational Structure

•
•  Desired  number  and  level  of  IT  expertise  or  competencies  in  bank's
human  resources,  plan  to  bridge  the  gap  (if  any)  and  requirements
relating to training and development

•  Strategy  for  keeping  abreast  with  technology  developments  and  update

systems as and when required

•  Strategies converted into clear IT Initiatives with a broad time frame

(b)  IT strategy and policy needs to be approved by the Board
(c)  Detailed  operational  procedures  may  be  formulated  in  relevant  areas

including for data centre operations

(d)  A  bank  needs  to  follow  a  structured  approach  for  the  long-range  planning
process considering factors such as organizational model and changes to it,
geographical  distribution,  technological  evolution,  costs,  legal  and  regulatory
requirements,  requirements  of  third-parties  or  market,  planning  horizon,
business process re-engineering, staffing, in- or outsourcing, etc.

(e)  There  needs  to  be  an  annual  review  of  IT  strategy  and  policies  taking  into
account the changes to the organization’s business plans and IT environment
(f)  Long-range IT strategy needs to be converted to short-range plans regularly,

for achievability

(g)  The  short-range  plan,  inter-alia,  may  cover  the  following:  plan  for  initiatives
specified  in  the  long-range  plan  or  initiatives  that  support  the  long-range
plans,  System  wise
for
achievement

transition  strategy,  Responsibility  and  plan

information  model

(h)  Banks need to establish and maintain an enterprise architecture framework or
enterprise
to  enable  applications  development  and
decision-supporting  activities,  consistent  with  IT  strategy.  The  model  should
facilitate optimal creation, use and sharing of information by a business, in a
way that it maintains integrity, and is flexible, functional, cost-effective, timely,
secure and resilient to failure

(i)  There  is  also  a  need  to  maintain  an  “enterprise  data  dictionary”  that

P a g e  | 7

incorporates  the  organization’s  data  syntax  rules.  This  should  enable  the
sharing  of  data  among  applications  and  systems,  promote  a  common
understanding  of  data  among  IT  and  business  users  and  preventing
incompatible data elements from being created

(j)  Banks  need  to  establish  a  classification  scheme  that  applies  throughout  the
enterprise, based on the criticality and sensitivity (e.g. public, confidential, or
top  secret)  of  enterprise  data.  This  scheme  should  include  details  of  data
ownership;  definition  of  appropriate  security  levels  and  protection  controls;
and  a  brief  description  of  data  retention  and  destruction  requirements
(criticality  and  sensitivity).  It  should  be  used  as  a  basis  for  applying  controls
such  as  access  controls,  archiving  or  encryption.  Banks  also  need  to  define
and implement procedures to ensure integrity and consistency of data stored
in electronic form (read: databases, warehouses and archives). More details
are indicated in the “Chapter: Information security”.

(k)  There is a need for a CIO in banks. He has to be the key business player and
a part of the executive decision-making function. His key role would be to be
the  owner  of  IT  functions:  enabling business  and  technology  alignment.  The
CIO  is  required  to  be  at  a  level  equivalent  to  that  of  the  Chief  General
Manager  (CGM)  or  General  Manager  (GM),  having  credible  operational
experience  or  proven  leadership  and  awareness  and  knowledge  of  IT  or
having related IT experience

(l)  Bank-wide  risk  management  policy  or  operational  risk  management  policy
needs  to  be  incorporate  IT-related  risks  also.  The  Risk  Management
Committee periodically reviews and updates the same (at least annually). The
IT risk function needs to be integrated into the operational risk management
function.

Some of the major issues in respect of control aspects that inter alia may be considered by
banks are:

1.  Major IT development projects need to be aligned with business strategy
2.  IT  investments  need  to be  suitably  balanced  between  maintaining  the  infrastructure
that support the bank's “as is” operations, and the infrastructure that transforms the
operations and enables the business to grow and compete in new areas

3.  IT-enabled  investment  programmes  and  other  IT  assets  and  services  are  managed
to  ascertain  that  they  deliver  the  greatest  possible  value  in  supporting  the  bank's
strategy and objectives:

Infrastructure to facilitate creation and sharing of business information

•
•  Flexibility  and  ensuring  programmes  are  amenable  to  maintenance  and

integration

•  They are functional, timely, secure and resilient to failure
•  Logically extends, maintains and manages disparate legacy systems and new

applications

•  Ensures standard, reusable and modular applications and components
4.  IT function supports robust and comprehensive Management Information System in
respect of various business functions as per the needs of the business that facilitate
decision making by management

5.  Project management and quality assurance steps should be implemented to ensure
systems are delivered on time, to cost and with the necessary level of functionality
6.  Project-level  steering  committees  needs  to  be  created  for  taking  responsibility  for
execution of the project plan, achievement of outcomes and project completion. The
various responsibilities include reviewing progress against the project plan, reviewing
and  approving  changes  to  project  resource  allocation,  time  lines,  objectives,  costs,

P a g e  | 8

keeping  the  project  scope  under  control  and  approving  changes  to  the  business
case, acting on escalated project issues and resolving conflicts between stakeholder
groups  and  assisting  in  evaluation  of  project  risks,  and  project  risk  management
approaches

7.  Periodical  review  of  all  non-performing  or  irrelevant  IT  projects  in  the  bank,  if  any,

and taking suitable actions

8.  IT management needs to assess IT risks and suitably mitigate them
9.  Bank’s risk management processes for its e-banking activities are integrated into its
overall  risk  management  approach.  A  process  should  be  in  place  to  have  effective
management  oversight  over  the  risks  associated  with  e-banking  activities,  including
specific accountability, policies and controls to manage these

10. Appropriate  measures  are  implemented  to  ensure  adherence  to  customer  privacy
requirements applicable to the jurisdictions to which the bank is providing e-banking
products and services, including foreign jurisdictions where the bank operates

11. Appropriate  procedures  are  implemented  to  comply  with  legislative,  regulatory  and
contractual requirements on the use of systems and software where IPR, copyrights
and on the use of proprietary software products are applicable

12. For managing project risks, a consistent and formally-defined programme and project
management  approach  needs  to  be  applied  to  IT  projects  that  enable  stakeholder
participation  and  monitoring  of  project  risks  and  progress.  Additionally,  for  major
projects, formal project risk assessment needs to be carried out and managed on an
ongoing basis

13. Inter-dependencies  between  risk  elements  are  considered  in  the  risk  assessment
to  compromise

threats  and  vulnerabilities  have

process,  as
interconnected and interdependent systems and processes

the  potential

14. Procedures  to  assess  the  integration  and  interoperability  of  complex  IT  processes
(such as problem, change and configuration management) exists before committing
additional investments

15. Tools  such  as  IT  balanced  scorecard  may  be  considered  for  implementation,  with
approval  from  key  stakeholders,  to  measure  performance  along  dimensions:
financial,  customer  satisfaction,  process  effectiveness,  future  capability  and  assess
IT  management  performance  based  on  metrics  such  as  scheduled  uptime,  service
levels, transaction throughput and response times and application availability

16.  Banks  may  also  consider  assessing  the  maturity  level,  set  a  target  as  per  the  IT
Governance maturity model, design an action plan and subsequently implement it to
reach the target maturity level

CHAPTER 2 – INFORMATION SECURITY

Introduction:

Information  and  the  knowledge  based  on  it  have  increasingly  become  recognized  as
‘information  assets’,  which  are  vital  enablers  of  business  operations.  Hence,  they  require
organizations to provide adequate levels of protection. For banks, as purveyors of money in
physical  form  or  in  bits  and  bytes,  reliable  information  is  even  more  critical  and  hence
information security is a vital area of concern.

Robust information is at the heart of risk management processes in a bank. Inadequate data
quality is likely to induce errors in decision making. Data quality requires building processes,
procedures  and  disciplines  for  managing  information  and  ensuring  its  integrity,  accuracy,
completeness  and  timeliness.  The  fundamental  attributes  supporting  data  quality  should
include  accuracy,  integrity,  consistency,  completeness,  validity,  timeliness,  accessibility,
usability and auditability. The data quality provided by various applications depends on the
quality  and  integrity  of  the  data  upon  which  that  information  is  built.  Entities  that  treat
information as a critical organizational asset are in a better position to manage it proactively.

Information security not only deals with information in various channels like spoken, written,
printed,  electronic  or  any  other  medium  but  also  information  handling  in  terms  of  creation,
viewing,  transportation,  storage  or  destruction  .This  is  in  contrast  to  IT  security  which  is
mainly  concerned  with  security  of  information  within  the  boundaries  of  the  network
infrastructure technology domain. From an information security perspective, the nature and
type of compromise is not as material as the fact that security has been breached.

To achieve effective information security governance, bank management must establish and
maintain  a  framework  to  guide  the  development  and  maintenance  of  a  comprehensive
information security programme.

Basic Principles of Information Security:

For over twenty years, information security has held confidentiality, integrity and availability
(known  as  the  CIA  triad)  to  be  the  core  principles.  There  is  continuous  debate  about
extending  this  classic  trio.  Other  principles  such  as  Authenticity,  Non-repudiation  and
accountability are also now becoming key considerations for practical security installations.

(cid:190)  Confidentiality:  Confidentiality  is  the  term  used  to  prevent  the  disclosure  of
information  to  unauthorized  individuals  or  systems.  For  example,  a  credit  card
transaction on the Internet requires the credit card number to be transmitted from the
buyer  to  the  merchant  and  from  the  merchant  to  a  transaction  processing  network.
The system attempts to enforce confidentiality by encrypting the card number during
transmission,  by  limiting  the  places  where  it  might  appear  (in  databases,  log  files,
backups, printed receipts, and so on), and by restricting access to the places where it
is stored. If an unauthorized party obtains the card number in any way, a breach of
confidentiality  has  occurred.  Breaches  of  confidentiality  take  many  forms  like
Hacking,  Phishing,  Vishing,  Email-spoofing,  SMS  spoofing,  and  sending  malicious
code through email or Bot Networks, as discussed earlier.

(cid:190)

Integrity:  In  information  security,  integrity  means  that  data  cannot  be  modified
without authorization. This is not the same thing as referential integrity in databases.

P a g e  | 10

Integrity  is  violated  when  an  employee  accidentally  or  with  malicious  intent  deletes
important  data  files,  when  he/she  is  able  to  modify  his  own  salary  in  a  payroll
database,  when  an  employee  uses  programmes  and  deducts  small  amounts  of
money  from  all  customer  accounts  and  adds  it  to  his/her  own  account  (also  called
salami technique), when an unauthorized user vandalizes a web site, and so on.
On  a  larger  scale,  if  an  automated  process  is  not  written  and  tested  correctly,  bulk
updates to a database could alter data in an incorrect way, leaving the integrity of the
data compromised. Information security professionals are tasked with finding ways to
implement controls that prevent errors of integrity.

(cid:190)  Availability:  For  any  information  system  to  serve  its  purpose,  the  information  must
be available when it is needed. This means that the computing systems used to store
and  process  the  information,  the  security  controls  used  to  protect  it,  and  the
communication  channels  used  to  access  it  must  be  functioning  correctly.  High
availability  systems  aim  to  remain  available  at  all  times,  preventing  service
disruptions due to power outages, hardware failures, and system upgrades. Ensuring
availability also involves preventing denial-of-service (DoS) and distributed denial-of
service (DDoS) attacks.

(cid:190)  Authenticity:  In  computing,  e-business  and  information  security  it  is  necessary  to
ensure  that  the  data,  transactions,  communications  or  documents  (electronic  or
physical) are genuine. It is also important for authenticity to validate that both parties
involved are who they claim they are.

(cid:190)  Non-repudiation:  In  law,  non-repudiation  implies  one's  intention  to  fulfill  one’s
obligations under a contract / transaction. It also implies that a party to a transaction
cannot  deny  having  received  or  having  sent  an  electronic  record.  Electronic
commerce  uses  technology  such  as  digital  signatures  and  encryption  to  establish
authenticity and non-repudiation.

In  addition  to  the  above,  there  are  other  security-related  concepts  and  principles
when  designing  a  security  policy  and  deploying  a  security  solution.  They  include
identification, authorization, accountability, and auditing.

(cid:190)

Identification: Identification is the process by which a subject professes an identity
and accountability is initiated. A subject must provide an identity to a system to start
the process of authentication, authorization and accountability. Providing an identity
can  be  typing  in  a  username,  swiping  a  smart  card,  waving  a  proximity  device,
speaking  a  phrase,  or  positioning  face,  hand,  or  finger  for  a  camera  or  scanning
device.  Proving  a  process  ID  number  also  represents  the  identification  process.
Without  an  identity,  a  system  has  no  way  to  correlate  an  authentication  factor  with
the subject.

(cid:190)  Authorization:  Once  a  subject  is  authenticated,  access  must  be  authorized.  The
process of authorization ensures that the requested activity or access to an object is
possible  given  the  rights  and  privileges  assigned  to  the  authenticated  identity.  In
most  cases,  the  system  evaluates  an  access  control  matrix  that  compares  the
subject,  the  object,  and  the  intended  activity.  If  the  specific  action  is  allowed,  the
subject is authorized. Else, the subject is not authorized.

(cid:190)  Accountability  and  auditability:  An  organization’s  security  policy  can  be  properly
enforced  only  if  accountability  is  maintained,  i.e.,  security  can  be  maintained  only  if
subjects  are  held  accountable  for  their  actions.  Effective  accountability  relies  upon
the capability to prove a subject’s identity and track their activities. Accountability is
established  by  linking  a  human  to  the  activities  of  an  online  identity  through  the

P a g e  | 11

security  services  and  mechanisms  of  auditing,  authorization,  authentication,  and
identification. Thus, human accountability is ultimately dependent on the strength of
the  authentication  process.  Without  a  reasonably  strong  authentication  process,
there is doubt that the correct human associated with a specific user account was the
actual entity controlling that user account when an undesired action took place.

Information Security Governance

Information  security  governance  consists  of  the  leadership,  organizational  structures  and
processes that protect information and mitigation of growing information security threats like
the ones detailed above.
Critical outcomes of information security governance include:

(cid:190)  Alignment  of  information  security  with  business  strategy  to  support  organizational

objectives

(cid:190)  Management and mitigation of risks and reduction of potential impacts on information

resources to an acceptable level

(cid:190)  Management  of  performance  of  information  security  by  measuring,  monitoring  and
reporting  information  security  governance  metrics  to  ensure  that  organizational
objectives are achieved

(cid:190)  Optimisation  of  information  security  investments  in  support  of  organizational

objectives

It  is  important  to  consider  the  organisational  necessity  and  benefits  of  information  security
governance.  They  include  increased  predictability  and  the  reduction  of  uncertainty  in
business  operations,  a  level  of  assurance  that  critical  decisions  are  not  based  on  faulty
information, enabling efficient and effective risk management, protection from the increasing
potential for legal liability, process improvement, reduced losses from security-related events
and  prevention  of  catastrophic  consequences  and  improved  reputation  in  the  market  and
among customers.

A comprehensive security programme needs to include the following main activities:

(cid:190)  Development and ongoing maintenance of security policies
(cid:190)  Assignment of roles, responsibilities and accountability for information security
(cid:190)  Development/maintenance  of  a  security  and  control  framework  that  consists  of

standards, measures, practices and procedures

(cid:190)  Classification and assignment of ownership of information assets
(cid:190)  Periodic  risk  assessments  and  ensuring  adequate,  effective  and  tested  controls  for

people, processes and technology to enhance information security

(cid:190)  Ensuring security is integral to all organizational processes
(cid:190)  Processes to monitor security incidents
(cid:190)  Effective identity and access management processes
(cid:190)  Generation of meaningful metrics of security performance
(cid:190)

Information  security  related  awareness  sessions  to  users/officials  including  senior
officials and board members

Organizational Structure, Roles and Responsibilities:

Boards of Directors/Senior Management

The Board of Directors is ultimately responsible for information security. Senior Management
is  responsible  for  understanding  risks  to  the  bank  to  ensure  that  they  are  adequately
addressed  from  a  governance  perspective.  To  do  so  effectively  requires  managing  risks,
including  information  security  risks,  by  integrating  information  security  governance  in  the

P a g e  | 12

overall  enterprise  governance  framework  of  the  organization.  It  is  reported  that  the
effectiveness  of  information  security  governance  is  dependent  on  the  involvement  of  the
Board/senior management in approving policy and appropriate monitoring of the information
security function.

The  major  role  of  top  management  involves  implementing  the  Board  approved  information
security policy, establishing necessary organizational processes for information security and
providing necessary resources for successful information security. It is essential that senior
management  establish  an  expectation  for  strong  cyber  security  and  communicate  this  to
their  officials  down  the  line.  It  is  also  essential  that  the  senior  organizational  leadership
establish  a  structure  for  implementation  of  an  information  security  programme  to  enable  a
consistent and effective information security programme implementation apart from ensuring
the accountability of individuals for their performance as it relates to cyber security.

Given that today’s banking is largely dependent on IT systems and since most of the internal
processing  requirements  of  banks  are  electronic,  it  is  essential  that  adequate  security
systems  are  fully  integrated  into  the  IT  systems  of  banks.  It  would  be  optimal  to  classify
these  based  on  the  risk  analysis  of  the  various  systems  in  each  bank  and  specific  risk
mitigation strategies need to be in place.

Information security team/function

Banks  should  form  a  separate  information  security  function/group  to  focus  exclusively  on
information security management. There should be segregation of the duties of the Security
Officer/Group  dealing  exclusively  with  information  systems  security  and  the  Information
Technology Division  which  actually  implements  the  computer  systems. The  organization  of
the  information  security  function  should  be  commensurate  with  the  nature  and  size  of
activities of a bank including a variety of e-banking systems and delivery channels of a bank.
The information security function should be adequately resourced in terms of the number of
staff,  level  of  skills  and  tools  or  techniques  like  risk  assessment,  security  architecture,
vulnerability  assessment,
information  security
forensic  assessment,  etc.  While
group/function  itself  and  information  security  governance  related  structures  should  not  be
outsourced,  specific  operational  components  relating  to  information  security  can  be
outsourced,  if  required  resources  are  not  available  within  a  bank.  However,  the  ultimate
control and responsibility rests with the bank.

the

Information Security Committee

Since  information  security  affects  all  aspects  of  an  organization,  in  order  to  consider
information security from a bank-wide perspective a steering committee of executives should
be  formed  with  formal  terms  of  reference.  The  Chief  Information  Security  Officer  would  be
the  member  secretary  of  the  Committee.  The  committee  may  include,  among  others,  the
Chief  Executive  Officer  (CEO)  or  designee,  chief  financial  officer  (CFO),  business  unit
executives, Chief Information Officer (CIO)/ IT Head, Heads of human resources, legal, risk
management, audit, operations and public relations.

A steering committee serves as an effective communication channel for management’s aims
and  directions  and  provides  an  ongoing  basis  for  ensuring  alignment  of  the  security
programme  with  organizational  objectives.  It  is  also  instrumental  in  achieving  behavior
change toward a culture that promotes good security practices and compliance with policies.

Major responsibilities of the Information Security Committee, inter-alia, include:

(cid:190)  Developing  and  facilitating  the  implementation  of  information  security  policies,
standards  and  procedures  to  ensure  that  all  identified  risks  are  managed  within  a
bank’s risk appetite

P a g e  | 13

(cid:190)  Approving  and  monitoring  major  information  security  projects  and  the  status  of
information  security  plans  and  budgets,  establishing  priorities,  approving  standards
and procedures

(cid:190)  Supporting the development and implementation of a bank-wide information security

management programme

(cid:190)  Reviewing  the  position  of  security  incidents  and  various  information  security

assessments and monitoring activities across the bank

(cid:190)  Reviewing the status of security awareness programmes
(cid:190)  Assessing new developments or issues relating to information security
(cid:190)  Reporting to the Board of Directors on information security activities

Minutes  of  the  Steering  Committee  meetings  should  be  maintained  to  document  the
committee’s  activities  and  decisions  and  a  review  on  information  security  needs  to  be
escalated to the Board on a quarterly basis.

Chief information security officer (CISO)

A  sufficiently  senior  level  official,  of  the  rank  of  GM/DGM/AGM,  should  be  designated  as
Chief Information Security Officer, responsible for articulating and enforcing the policies that
banks  use  to  protect  their  information  assets  apart  from  coordinating  the  security  related
issues  /  implementation  within  the  organization  as  well  as  relevant  external  agencies.  The
CISO needs to report directly to the Head of Risk Management and should not have a direct
reporting relationship with the CIO. However, the CISO may have a working relationship with
the CIO to develop the required rapport to understand the IT infrastructure and operations, to
build  effective  security  in  IT  across  the  bank,  in  tune  with  business  requirements  and
objectives.

Critical components of information security:

1)  Policies and procedures:

1)  Banks  need  to  frame  Board  approved  Information  Security  Policy  and  identify  and
implement appropriate information security management measures/practices keeping
in view their business needs.

2)  The  policies  need  to  be  supported  with  relevant  standards,  guidelines  and
procedures. A policy framework would, inter-alia, incorporate/take into consideration
the following:

a.  An  information  security  strategy  that  is  aligned  with  business  objectives  and

the legal requirements

Information security organisational structure

b.  Objectives, scope, ownership and responsibility for the policy
c.
d.  Information  security  roles  and  responsibilities  that  may  include  information
security-specific  roles  like    IT  security  manager/officer,  administrators,
information  security  specialists  and  information  asset-specific  roles  like
owners, custodians, end-users

e.  Periodic reviews of the policy – at least annually and in the event of significant

changes necessitating revision

f.  A periodic compliance review of the policy – about the adherence of users to
information security policies and put up to the information security committee.
g.  Exceptions:  An  exception  policy  for  handling  instances  of  non-compliance
with  the  information  security  policy  including  critical  aspects  like  exception
criteria including whether there is genuine need for exceptions, management
of  the  exception  log  or  register,  authority  to  grant  exemptions,  expiry  of
exceptions  and  the  periodicity  of  review  of  exceptions  granted.  Where
exemptions  are  granted,  banks  need  to  review  and  assess  the  adequacy  of
compensating controls initially and on an ongoing basis. A sign -off  needs to
be obtained from the CISO on the exceptions

P a g e  | 14

h.  Penal measures for violation of policies and the process to be followed in the

i.

event of violation
 Identification,  authorisation  and  granting  of  access  to  IT  assets  (by
individuals and other IT assets)

j.  Addressing the various stages of an IT asset’s life to ensure that information

security requirements are considered at each stage of the lifecycle

k.  An incident monitoring and management process to address the identification
and classification of incidents, reporting, escalation, preservation of evidence,
the investigation process

l.  Management  of  technology  solutions  for  information  security  like  a  firewall,
intrusion  detection/prevention  systems,

anti-virus/anti-malware  software,
cryptographic systems and monitoring/log analysis tools/techniques

m.  Management and monitoring of service providers that provides for overseeing

the management of information security risks by third parties

n.  Clearly indicating acceptable usage of IT assets including application systems
that  define  the  information  security  responsibilities  of  users  (staff,  service
providers and customers) in regard to the use of IT assets

o.  Requirements  relating  to  recruitment  and  selection  of  qualified  staff  and
external  contractors  that  define  the  framework  for  vetting  and  monitoring  of
personnel, taking into account the information security risk

p.  Strategy  for  periodic  training  and  enhancing  skills  of  information  security

personnel, requirement of continuous professional education

q.  Specific    policies  that  would  be  required  include,  but  not  limited  to,  the

following:

i.  Logical Access Control
ii.  Asset Management
iii.  Network Access Control
iv.  Password management
v.  E-mail security
vi.  Remote access
vii.  Mobile computing
viii.  Network security
ix.  Application security
x.  Backup and archival
xi.  Operating system security
xii.  Database administration and security
xiii.  Physical security
xiv.  Capacity Management
xv.  Incident response and management
xvi.  Malicious software
xvii.  IT asset/media management
xviii.  Change Management
xix.  Patch Management
xx.  Internet security
xxi.  Desktop
xxii.  Encryption
xxiii.  Security of electronic delivery channels
xxiv.  Wireless security
xxv.  Application/data migration

3)  Accountability  for  security  is  increased  through  clear  job  descriptions,  employment
to
agreements  and  policy  awareness  acknowledgements.
communicate  the  general  and  specific  security  roles  and  responsibilities  for  all
employees  within  their  job  descriptions.  The  job  descriptions  for  security  personnel
should  also  clearly  describe  the  systems  and  processes  they  will  protect  and  their

important

is

It

P a g e  | 15

responsibility towards control processes. Management should expect all employees,
officers  and  contractors/consultants  to  comply  with  security  and  acceptable-use
policies and protect the institution’s assets, including information.

4)  Given  the  critical  role  of  security  technologies  as  part  of  the  information  security
framework, banks need to subject them to suitable controls across their lifecycle like
guidelines  on  their  usage,  standards  and  procedures  indicating  the  detailed
objectives  and  requirements  of  individual  information  security-specific  technology
solutions,  authorisation  for  individuals  who  would  be  handling  the  technology,
addressing  segregation  of  duties  issues,  appropriate  configurations  of  the  devices
that  provide  the  best  possible  security,  regularly  assessing  their  effectiveness  and
fine-tuning them accordingly, and identification of any unauthorised changes.

5)  Digital  evidence  is  similar  to  any  other  form  of  legal  proof  -  it  needs  to  withstand
challenges  to  its  integrity,  its  handling  must  be  carefully  tracked  and  documented,
and  it  must  be  suitably  authenticated  by  concerned  personnel  as  per  legal
requirements.  Since  the  evidence  resides  on  or  is  generated  by  a  digital  device,  a
trained information security official or skilled digital forensics examiner  may need to
be  involved  in  the  handling  process  to  ensure  that  any  material  facts  is  properly
preserved and introduced.  A suitable policy needs to be in place in this regard.

2)  Risk Assessment

1)  The likelihood that a threat will use a vulnerability to cause harm creates a risk. When a
threat  does  use  a  vulnerability  to  inflict  harm,  it  has  an  impact.  In  the  context  of
information security, the impact is a loss of availability, integrity and confidentiality, and
possibly other losses (lost income, loss of life, loss of property).

2)  Risk assessment is the core competence of information security management. The risk
assessment  must,  for  each  asset  within  its  scope,  identify  the  threat/vulnerability
combinations  that  have  a  likelihood  of  impacting  the  confidentiality,  availability  or
integrity  of  that  asset  -  from  a  business,  compliance  or  contractual  perspective.
Standards like ISO27001 and ISO 27002 are explicit in requiring a risk assessment to
be  carried  out  before  any  controls  are  selected  and  implemented  and  are  equally
explicit that the selection of every control must be justified by a risk assessment.

3)  In broad terms, the risk management process consists of:

(cid:131)

Identification  of  assets  and  estimation  of  their  value.  Some  aspects  to  be  included
are people, buildings, hardware, software, data (electronic, print) and supplies

(cid:131)  Conducting a threat assessment which may include aspects like acts of nature, acts
of war, accidents, malicious acts originating from inside or outside the organization
(cid:131)  Conducting  a  vulnerability  assessment  for  each  vulnerability  and  calculating  the
probability  that  it  will  be  exploited.  Evaluating  policies,  procedures,  standards,
training, physical security, quality control and technical security in this regard

(cid:131)  Calculating the impact that each threat would have on each asset through qualitative

(cid:131)

or quantitative analysis
Identifying,  selecting  and  implementing  appropriate  controls.  Providing  proportional
response including considerations like productivity, cost effectiveness, and the value
of the asset

(cid:131)  Evaluating  the  effectiveness  of  the  control  measures.  Ensuring  the  controls  provide

the required cost-effective protection.

4)  The  process  of  risk  management  is  an  ongoing  iterative  process.  The  business
environment  is  constantly  changing  and  new  threats  and  vulnerabilities  emerge  every
day.  The  choice  of  countermeasures  or  controls  used  to  manage  risks  must  strike  a
balance between productivity, cost-effectiveness of the countermeasure and the value

P a g e  | 16

of the informational asset being protected. The risk assessment should be carried out
by  a  team  of  people  who  have  knowledge  of  specific  areas  of  the  business.  The
assessment  may  use  a  subjective  qualitative  analysis  based  on  informed  opinion,  or
where reliable figures and historical information is available, quantitative analysis.

5)  Quantitative  methods  involve  assigning  numerical  measurements  that  can  be  entered
into  the  analysis  to  determine  total  and  residual  risks.  The  various  aspects  that  are
considered  a  part  of  measurements  include  costs  to  safeguard  the  information  and
information systems, value of that information and those systems, threat frequency and
probability, and the effectiveness of controls. A shortcoming of quantitative methods is a
lack  of  reliable  and  predictive  data  on  threat  frequency  and  probability.  This
shortcoming  is  generally  addressed  by  assigning  numeric  values  based  on  qualitative
judgments.

6)  Qualitative  analysis  involves  the  use  of  scenarios  and  attempts  to  determine  the
seriousness  of  threats  and  the  effectiveness  of  controls.  Qualitative  analysis  is  by
definition  subjective,  relying  upon  judgment,  knowledge,  prior  experience  and  industry
information. Qualitative techniques may include walk-throughs, surveys/questionnaires,
interviews and specific workgroups to obtain information about the various scenarios.

3)  Inventory and information/data classification

Effective  control  requires  a  detailed  inventory  of  information  assets.  Such  a  list  is  the  first
step in classifying the assets and determining the level of protection to be provided to each
asset.

The inventory record of each information asset should, at the least, include:

•  A clear and distinct identification of the asset
•
•
•
•
•
•

Its relative value to the organization
Its location
Its security/risk classification
Its asset group (where the asset forms part of a larger information system)
Its owner
Its designated custodian

Information  assets  have  varying  degrees  of  sensitivity  and  criticality  in  meeting  business
objectives.  By  assigning  classes  or  levels  of  sensitivity  and  criticality  to  information
resources and establishing specific security rules/requirements for each class, it is possible
to  define  the  level  of  access  controls  that  should  be  applied  to  each  information  asset.
Classification  of  information  reduces  the  risk  and  cost  of  over-  or  under-  protecting
information resources in aligning security with business objectives since it helps to build and
maintain  a  consistent  and  uniform  perspective  of  the  security  requirements  for  information
assets  throughout  the  organization.  ISO  27001  standards  require  the  inventorying  of
information assets and the classification, handling and labelling of information in accordance
with preset guidelines.

4)  Defining roles and responsibilities

All defined and documented responsibilities and accountabilities must be established and
communicated to all relevant personnel and management. Some of the major ones include:

Information owner
This is a business executive or business manager who is responsible for a bank’s business
information asset. Responsibilities would include, but not be limited to:

P a g e  | 17

(cid:131)  Assigning initial information classification and periodically reviewing the

classification to ensure it still meets business needs

(cid:131)  Ensuring security controls are in place commensurate with the classification
(cid:131)  Reviewing and ensuring currency of the access rights associated with information

assets they own

(cid:131)  Determining security requirements, access criteria and backup requirements for

the information assets they own

Information custodian
The information custodian, usually an information systems official, is the delegate of the
information owner with primary responsibilities for dealing with backup and recovery of the
business information. Responsibilities include, but are not limited to, the following:

(cid:131)  Performing backups according to the backup requirements established by the

information owner

(cid:131)  When necessary, restoring lost or corrupted information from backup media to

return the application to production status

(cid:131)  Ensuring record retention requirements are met based on the information owner’s

requirements

Application owner
The application owner is the manager of the business line who is fully accountable for the
performance of the business function served by the application. Responsibilities, inter-alia,
include:

(cid:131)  Establishing  user  access  criteria,  availability  requirements  and  audit  trails  for  their

applications

(cid:131)  Ensuring  security  controls  associated  with  the  application  are  commensurate  with

support for the highest level of information classification used by the application

(cid:131)  Performing or delegating the following - day-to-day security administration, approval
of exception access requests, appropriate actions on security violations when notified
by  the  security  administration,  the  review  and  approval  of  all  changes  to  the
application prior to being placed in the production environment, and verification of the
currency of user access rights to the application

User manager
The user manager is the immediate manager or supervisor of an employee or HR official of
the business function in which an employee works. He has the ultimate responsibility for all
user  IDs  and  information  assets  owned  by  bank  employees.  In  the  case  of  non  employee
individuals such as contractors, consultants, etc., this manager is responsible for the activity
and  for  the  bank  assets  used  by  these  individuals.  He/she  is  usually  the  manager
responsible for hiring the outside contractor. Responsibilities include the following:

(cid:131)

(cid:131)

Informing security administration of the termination of any employee so that the user
ID  owned  by  that  individual  can  be  revoked,  suspended  or  made  inaccessible  in  a
timely manner
Informing  security  administration  of  the  transfer  of  any  employee  if  the  transfer
involves the change of access rights or privileges

(cid:131)  Reporting  any  security  incident  or  suspected  incident  to  the  Information  Security

function

(cid:131)  Ensuring  that  employees  are  aware  of  relevant  security  policies,  procedures  and

standards to which they are accountable

Security Administrator
Security  administrators have  the  powers  to  set system-wide  security  controls  or  administer
user  IDs  and  information  resource  access  rights.  These  security  administrators  usually
report to the Information Security function. Responsibilities include the following:

P a g e  | 18

(cid:131)  Understanding different data environments and the impact of granting access to them
(cid:131)  Ensuring access requests are consistent with the information directions and security

guidelines

(cid:131)  Administering  access  rights  according  to  criteria  established  by  the  Information

Owners

(cid:131)  Creating and removing user IDs as directed by the user manager
(cid:131)  Administering  the  system  within  the  scope  of  their  job  description  and  functional

responsibilities

(cid:131)  Distributing and following up on security violation reports

End user
The  end  users  would  be  any  employees,  contractors  or  vendors  of  the  bank  who  use
information systems resources as part of their job. Responsibilities include :

(cid:131)  Maintaining confidentiality of log-in password(s)
(cid:131)  Ensuring security of information entrusted to their care
(cid:131)  Using bank business assets and information resources for management approved

purposes only

(cid:131)  Adhering to all information security policies, procedures, standards and guidelines
(cid:131)  Promptly reporting security incidents to management.

5)  Access Control

(i)  An  effective  process  for  access  to  information  assets  is  one  of  the  critical
requirements  of  information  security.    Internal  sabotage,  clandestine  espionage  or
furtive  attacks  by  trusted  employees,  contractors  and  vendors  are  among  the  most
serious  potential  risks  that  a  bank  faces.  Current  and  past  employees,  contractors,
vendors  and  those  who  have  an  intimate  knowledge  of  the  inner  workings  of  the
bank’s  systems,  operations  and  internal  controls  have  a  significant  advantage  over
external  attackers.  A  successful  attack  could  jeopardise  customer  confidence  in  a
bank’s internal control systems and processes.

(ii)  Hence, access to information assets needs to be authorised by a bank only where a
valid  business  need  exists  and  only  for  the  specific  time  period  that  the  access  is
required. The various factors that need to be considered when authorising access to
users  and  information  assets,  inter-alia,  include  business  role,  physical  location,
method of connectivity, remote access, time, anti-malware and patch updation status,
nature of device used and software /operating system.

(iii) The provision of access involves various stages like identification and authentication
which  involves  determination  of  the  person  or  IT  asset  requesting  access  and
confirmation of the purported identity and authorisation. This involves an assessment
of whether access is allowed to an information asset by the request or based on the
needs  of  the  business  and  the  level  of  information  security  required.    These
processes are applicable to both users as well as IT assets.

(iv) A  bank  should  take  appropriate  measures  to  identify  and  authenticate  users  or  IT
assets. The required strength of authentication needs to be commensurate with risk.
Common  techniques  for  increasing  the  strength  of  identification  and  authentication
include the use of strong password techniques (i.e. increased length, complexity, re-
use  limitations  and  frequency  of  change)  and  increasing  the  number  and/or  type  of
authentication factors used.

(v) The  examples  where  increased  authentication  strength  may  be  required,  given  the
risks involved include : administration or other privileged access to sensitive or critical
IT  assets,  remote  access  through  public  networks  to  sensitive  assets  and  activities
carrying  higher  risk  like  third-party  fund  transfers,  etc.  The  period  for  which
authentication is valid would need to be commensurate with the risk.

(vi) Among the important controls that banks need to consider are:

P a g e  | 19

(a)  A  systematic  process  of  applying  and  authorizing  the  creation  of  user  ids

and the access control matrix

(b)  Conducting  a  risk  assessment  and  granting  access  rights  based  on  the
same.  For  example,  contractors  and  temporary  staff  would  have  higher
inherent risks

(c)  Implementation  of  role-based  access  control  policies  designed  to  ensure

effective segregation of duties

(d)  Changing default user names and/or passwords of systems and prohibiting

sharing of  user ids and passwords including generic accounts

(e)  Modification  of  access  rights  whenever  there  is  a  change  in  role  or
responsibility and removal of access rights on cessation of employment
(f)  Processes  to  notify  in  a  timely  manner  the  information  security  function

regarding user additions, deletions and role changes

(g)   Periodic reconciliation of user ids in a system and actual users required to

have access and deletion of unnecessary ids, if any

(h)  Audit of logging and monitoring of access to IT assets by all users
(i)  Regular  reviews  of  user  access  by  information  asset  owners  to  ensure

appropriate access is maintained

(j)  Applying the four-eyes principle to very critical/sensitive IT assets
(k)  Considering de-activating user ids of users of critical applications who are

on prolonged leave

(vii) Banks  may  consider  using  automated  solutions  to  enable  effective  access  control
and management of user ids. Such solutions should also be managed effectively to
ensure robust access management.

(viii) For  accountability  purposes,  a  bank  should  ensure  that  users  and  IT  assets  are

uniquely identified and their actions are auditable.

(ix) Transaction  processes  and  systems  should  be  designed  to  ensure  that  no  single
employee/outsourced  service  provider  could  enter,  authorize  and  complete  a
transaction.

(x) Segregation should be maintained between those initiating static data (including web
page  content)  and  those  responsible  for  verifying  its  integrity.  Further,  segregation
should be maintained between those developing and those administering e-banking
systems.

(xi) E-banking systems should be tested to ensure that segregation of duties cannot be

bypassed.

(xii)  Mutual authentication system may be considered. Mutual Authentication, also called
two-way authentication, is a security feature in which a client process must prove his
identity  to  a  server,  and  the  server  must  prove  its  identity  to  the  client,  before  any
application  traffic  is  sent  over  the  client-to-server  connection.  Identity  can  be  proved
through  a  trusted  third  party  and  use  of  shared  secrets  or  through  cryptographic
means  as  with  a  public  key  infrastructure.  For  e.g.,  with  the  mutual  authentication
implemented,  a  connection  can  occur  only  when  the  client  trusts  the  server's  digital
certificate and the server trusts the client's certificate. The exchange of certificates will
happen  through  special  protocols  like  the  Transport  Layer  Security  (TLS)  protocol.
This  process  reduces  the  risk  that  an  unsuspecting  network  user  will  inadvertently
reveal security information to a malicious or insecure web site.

(xiii) System  administrators,  security  officers,  programmers  and  staff  performing  critical
operations  invariably  possess  the  capability  to  inflict  severe  damage  on  the  banking
systems they maintain or operate by virtue of their job functions and privileged access.
Personnel with elevated system access entitlements should be closely supervised with
all their systems activities logged, as they have inside knowledge and the resources to
circumvent systems controls and security procedures. Some of the control and security
practices enumerated below needs to be considered:

a)  Implementing two-factor authentication for privileged users
b)  Instituting strong controls over remote access by privileged users

P a g e  | 20

c)  Restricting the number of privileged users
d)  Granting privileged access on a “need-to-have”  or “need-to-do” basis
e)  Maintaining audit logging of system activities performed by privileged users
f)  Ensuring that privileged users do not have access to systems logs in which

their activities are being captured

g)  Conducting regular audit or management review of the logs
h)  Prohibiting sharing of privileged IDs and their access codes
i)  Disallowing vendors and contractors from gaining privileged access to

systems without close supervision and monitoring
j)  Protecting backup data from unauthorized access.

6)  Information security and information asset life-cycle

(i)  Information  security  needs  to  be  considered  at  all  stages  of  an  information  asset’s
life-cycle  like  planning,  design,  acquisition  and  implementation,  maintenance  and
disposal. Banks need to apply systematic project management oriented techniques to
manage material changes during these stages and to ensure that information security
requirements have been adequately addressed.

(ii)  Planning  and  design  level  controls  need  to  be  in  place  to  ensure  that  information
security  is  embodied  in  the  overall  information  systems  architecture  and  the
implemented  solutions  are  in  compliance  with  the  information  security  policies  and
requirements of a bank.

(iii) Ongoing support and maintenance controls would be needed to ensure that IT assets
continue  to  meet  business  objectives.  Major  controls  in  this  regard  include  change
management  controls  to  ensure  that  the  business  objectives  continue  to  be  met
following change; configuration management controls to ensure that the configuration
minimises  vulnerabilities  and  is  defined,  assessed,  maintained  and  managed;
deployment  and  environment  controls  to  ensure  that  development,  test  and
production  environments  are  appropriately  segregated;  and  patch  management
controls  to  manage  the  assessment  and  application  of  patches  to  software  that
addresses known vulnerabilities in a timely manner

(iv) The other relevant controls include service level management, vendor management,
capacity  management  and  configuration  management  which  are  described  in  later
chapters. Decommissioning and destruction controls need to be used to ensure that
information security is not compromised as IT assets reach the end of their useful life.
(for example, through archiving strategies and deletion of sensitive information prior
to the disposal of IT assets.)

7)  Personnel security

(i)  Application  owners  grant  legitimate  users  access  to  systems  that  are  necessary  to
perform their duties and security personnel enforce the access rights in accordance
with  institution  standards.  Because  of  their  internal  access  levels  and  intimate
knowledge of financial institution processes, authorized users pose a potential threat
to  systems  and  data.  Employees,  contractors,  or  third-party  employees  can  also
exploit their legitimate computer access for malicious or fraudulent reasons. Further,
the  degree  of  internal  access  granted  to  some  users  can  increase  the  risk  of
accidental damage or loss of information and systems.

(ii)  Risk  exposures  from  internal  users  include  altering  data,  deleting  production  and
back-up  data,  disrupting/destroying  systems,  misusing  systems  for  personal  gain  or
to  damage  the  institution,  holding  data  hostage  and  stealing  strategic  or  customer
data for espionage or fraud schemes.

(iii) Banks  should  have  a  process  to  verify  job  application  information  on  all  new
employees. Additional background and credit checks may be warranted based on the
sensitivity  of  a  particular  job  or  access  level.  Personnel  with  privileged  access  like
administrators,  cyber  security  personnel,  etc.  should  be  subjected  to  rigorous

P a g e  | 21

background  checks  and  screening.  Institutions  should  verify  that  contractors  are
subject  to  similar  screening  procedures.  The  verification  considerations  would
include:
- Character references – business and personal
- Confirmation of prior experience, academic record, and professional qualifications
- Confirmation of identity through a government issued identification

(iv) There also needs to be a periodic rotation of duties among users or personnel as a

prudent risk measure.

8)  Physical security

(i)  The  confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability  of  information  can  be  impaired  through
physical  access  and  damage  or  destruction  to  physical  components.  Conceptually,
those  physical  security  risks  are  mitigated  through  zone-oriented  implementations.
Zones  are  physical  areas  with  differing  physical  security  requirements.  The  security
requirements  of  each  zone  are  a  function  of  the  sensitivity  of  the  data  contained  or
accessible through the zone and the information technology components in the zone.
(ii)  The requirements for each zone should be determined through the risk assessment.
The risk assessment should include, but is not limited to, threats like aircraft crashes,
chemical  effects,  dust,  electrical  supply  interference,  electromagnetic  radiation,
explosives,    fire,    smoke,    theft/destruction,    vibration/earthquake,    water,  criminals,
terrorism,    political  issues  (e.g.  strikes,  disruptions)  and  other  threats  based  on  the
entity’s  unique  geographical
location,  building  configuration,  neighboring
environment/entities, etc.

(iii)  A bank needs to deploy the following environmental controls:

-  Secure  location  of  critical  assets  providing  protection  from  natural  and  man-made
threats
-  Restrict  access  to  sensitive  areas  like  data  centres,  which  also  includes  detailed
procedures for handling access by staff, third party providers and visitors
- Suitable preventive mechanisms for various threats indicated above
- Monitoring mechanisms for the detection of compromises of environmental controls
relating  to  temperature,  water,  smoke,  access  alarms,  service  availability  alerts
(power supply, telecommunication, servers), access log reviews etc

9)  User Training and Awareness

It is acknowledged that the human link is the weakest link in the information security chain.
Hence,  there  is  a  vital  need  for  an  initial  and  ongoing  training  and  information  security
awareness  programme.  The  programme  may  be  periodically  updated  keeping  in  view
changes in information security, threats/vulnerabilities and/or the bank’s information security
framework.  There  needs  to  be  a  mechanism  to  track  the  effectiveness  of  training
programmes through an assessment/testing process designed on testing the understanding
of the relevant information security policies, not only initially but also on a periodic basis.  At
any  point  of  time,  a  bank  needs  to  maintain  an  updated  status  on  user  training  and
awareness relating to information security and the matter needs to be an important agenda
item during Information Security Committee meetings.

Some  of  the  areas  that  could  be  incorporated  as  part  of  the  user  awareness  programme
include:

a)  Relevant information security policies/procedures
b)  Acceptable and appropriate usage of IT assets

P a g e  | 22

c)  Access  controls  including  standards  relating  to  passwords  and  other  authentication

requirements

d)  Measures relating to proper email usage and internet usage
e)  Physical protection
f)  Remote computing and use of mobile devices
g)  Safe handling of sensitive data/information
h)  Being wary of social engineering attempts to part with confidential details
i)  Prompt reporting of any security incidents and concerns

10) Incident management

(i)  Incident  management  is  defined  as  the  process  of  developing  and  maintaining  the
capability  to  manage  incidents  within  a  bank  so  that  exposure  is  contained  and
recovery achieved within a specified time objective. Incidents can include the misuse
of  computing  assets,  information  disclosure  or  events  that  threaten  the  continuance
of business processes.

(ii)  Major  activities  that  need  to  be  considered  as  part  of  the  incident  management

framework include:

a.  Developing and implementing processes for preventing, detecting, analyzing

and responding to information security incidents

b.  Establishing escalation and communication processes and lines of authority
c.  Developing plans to respond to and document information security incidents
d.  Establishing  the  capability  to  investigate  information  security  incidents
through  various  modes  like  forensics,  evidence  collection  and  preservation,
log analysis, interviewing, etc.

e.  Developing  a  process  to  communicate  with  internal  parties  and  external

(iii) Common  incident  types  include,  but  not  limited  to,  outages/degradation  of  services
due  to  hardware,  software  or  capacity  issues,  unauthorised  access  to  systems,
identity  theft,  data  leakage/loss,  malicious  software  and  hardware,  failed  backup
processes, denial of service attacks and data integrity issues.

(iv)  A bank needs to have clear accountability and communication strategies to limit the
impact  of  information  security  incidents  through  defined  mechanisms  for  escalation
and  reporting  to  the  Board  and  senior  management  and  customer  communication,
where  appropriate.    Incident  management  strategies  would  also  typically  assist  in
compliance with regulatory requirements. Institutions would also need to pro-actively
notify CERT-In/IDRBT/RBI regarding cyber security incidents.

(v) All security incidents or violations of security policies should be brought to the notice

of the CISO.

11) Application Control and Security:

a. Financial institutions have different types of applications like the core banking system,
delivery channels like ATMs, internet banking, mobile banking, phone banking, network
operating  systems,  databases,  enterprise  resource  management  (ERP)  systems,
customer relationship management (CRM) systems, etc.,  all used for different business
purposes.  Then  these  institutions  have  partners,  contractors,  consultants,  employees
and  temporary  employees.  Users  usually  access  several  different  types  of  systems
throughout their daily tasks, which makes controlling access and providing the necessary
level  of  protection  on  different  data  types  difficult  and  full  of  obstacles.  This  complexity
may  result  in  unforeseen  and  unidentified  holes  in  the  protection  of  the  entire
infrastructure including overlapping and contradictory controls, and policy and regulatory
noncompliance.

b. There are well-known information systems security issues associated with applications
software,  whether  the  software  is  developed  internally  or  acquired  from  an  external
source .Attackers can potentially use many different paths through the application to do
harm  to  the  business.  Each  of  these  paths  represents  a  risk  that  may  or  may  not  be
serious enough to warrant attention. Sometimes, these paths are easy to find and exploit
and sometimes they are extremely difficult. Similarly, the harm that is caused may range
from  minor  to  major.  To  determine  the  risk  to  itself,  a  bank  can  evaluate  the  likelihood
associated  with  the  threat  agent,  attack  vector,  and  security  weakness  and  combine  it
with  an  estimate  of  the  technical  and  business  impact  to  the  organization.  Together,
these factors determine the overall risk.

c. The following are the important  Application control and risk mitigation measures
that need to be implemented by banks:

1.  Each application should have an owner which will typically be the concerned

business function that uses the application
2.  Some of the roles of application owners include:

(cid:190)  Prioritizing any changes to be made to the application and authorizing the

changes

(cid:190)  Deciding  on  data  classification/de-classification  and  archival/purging
procedures  for  the  data  pertaining  to  an  application  as  per  relevant
policies/regulatory/statutory requirements

(cid:190)  Ensuring  that  adequate  controls  are  built  into  the  application  through
active  involvement  in  the  application  design,  development,  testing  and
change process

(cid:190)  Ensuring  that  the  application  meets  the  business/functional  needs  of  the

users

(cid:190)  Ensuring  that  the  information  security  function  has  reviewed  the  security

of the application

(cid:190)  Taking  decisions  on  any  new  applications  to  be  acquired  /  developed  or

(cid:190)

any old applications to be discarded
Informing  the  information  security  team  regarding  purchase  of  an
application  and  assessing  the  application  based  on  the  security  policy
requirements

(cid:190)  Ensuring  that  the  Change  Management  process  is  followed  for  any

changes in application

(cid:190)  Ensuring that the new applications being purchased/developed follow the

Information Security policy

(cid:190)  Ensuring that logs or audit trails, as required, are enabled and monitored

for the applications

P a g e  | 24

3.  All  application  systems  need  to  be  tested  before  implementation  in  a  robust
manner regarding controls to ensure that they satisfy business policies/rules
of  the  bank  and  regulatory  and  legal  prescriptions/requirements.  Robust
controls need to be built into the system and reliance on any manual controls
needs  to  be  minimized.  Before  the  system  is  live,  there  should  be  clarity  on
the audit trails and the specific fields that are required to be captured as part
of audit trails and an audit trail or log monitoring process including personnel
responsible for the same.

to  vulnerabilities.  Besides  business

4.  A  bank  needs  to  incorporate  information  security  at  all  stages  of  software
development. This would assist in improving software quality and minimizing
exposure
functionalities,  security
requirements  relating  to  system  access  control,  authentication,  transaction
authorization, data integrity, system activity logging, audit trail, security event
tracking  and  exception  handling  are  required  to  be  clearly  specified  at  the
initial stages of system development/acquisition. A compliance check against
the  bank’s  security  standards  and  regulatory/statutory  requirements  would
also be required.

5.  All  application  systems  need  to  have  audit  trails  along  with  policy/procedure
of  log  monitoring  for  such  systems  including  the  clear  allocation  of
responsibility  in  this  regard.  Every  application  affecting  critical/sensitive
information,  for  example,  impacting  financial,  customer,  control,  regulatory
and legal aspects, must provide for detailed audit trails/ logging capability with
details  like  transaction  id,  date,  time,  originator  id,  authorizer  id,  actions
undertaken by a given user id, etc. Other details like logging the IP address of
the client machine, terminal identity or location may also be considered.
6.  Applications  must  also  provide  for,  inter-alia,    logging  unsuccessful  logon
attempts,    access  to  sensitive  options  in  the  application,  e.g.,  master  record
changes, granting of access rights, use of system utilities, changes in system
configuration, etc.

7.  The  audit  trails  need  to  be  stored  as  per  a  defined  period  as  per  any
internal/regulatory/statutory  requirements  and  it  should  be  ensured  that  they
are not tampered with.

8.  There  should  be  documented  standards/procedures  for  administering  the
application, which are approved by the application owner and kept up-to-date.
9.  The  development,  test  and  production  environments  need  to  be  properly

segregated.

10. Access should be based on the principle of least privilege and “need to know”
commensurate  with  the  job  responsibilities.  Adequate  segregation  of  duties
needs to be enforced.

11. There  should  be  controls  on  updating  key  ‘static’  business  information  like

customer master files, parameter changes, etc.

12. Any  changes  to  an  application  system/data  need  to  be  justified  by  genuine
business need and approvals supported by documentation and subjected to a
robust change management process. The change management would involve
generating  a  request,  risk  assessment,  authorization  from  an  appropriate
authority, implementation, testing and verification of the change done.

13. Potential  security  weaknesses  /  breaches  (for  example,  as  a  result  of
analyzing user behaviour or patterns of network traffic) should be identified.
14. There  should  be  measures  to  reduce  the  risk  of  theft,  fraud,  error  and
unauthorized  changes  to  information  through  measures  like  supervision  of
activities and segregation of duties.

15.  Applications  must  not  allow  unauthorized  entries  to  be  updated  in  the
database. Similarly, applications must not allow any modifications to be made
after an entry is authorized. Any subsequent changes must be made only by
reversing the original authorized entry and passing a fresh entry.

P a g e  | 25

16. Direct  back-end  updates  to  database  should  not  be  allowed  except  during
exigencies, with a clear business need and after due authorization as per the
relevant policy.

17. Access  to  the  database  prompt  must  be  restricted  only  to  the  database

administrator.

18. Robust input validation controls, processing and output controls needs to be

built in to the application.

19. There  should  be  a  procedure  in  place  to  reduce  the  reliance  on  a  few  key

individuals.

20. Alerts  regarding  use  of  the  same  machine  for  both  maker  and  checker

transactions need to be considered.

21. There  should  be  a  proper  linkage  between  a  change  request  and  the
corresponding  action  taken.  For  example,  the  specific  accounting  head  or
code  which  was  created  as  a  result  of  a  specific  request  should  be
established clearly.

22. Error / exception reports and logs need to be reviewed and any issues need

to be remedied /addressed at the earliest.

23. Critical  functions  or  applications  dealing  with  financial,  regulatory  and  legal,
MIS  and  risk  assessment/management,  (for  example,  calculation  of  capital
adequacy,  ALM,  calculating  VaR,  risk  weighted  assets,  NPA  classification
and  provisioning,  balance  sheet  compilation,  AML  system,  revaluation  of
foreign currency balances, computation of MTM gains / losses, etc.,) needs to
be  done  through  proper  application  systems  and  not  manually  or  in  a  semi-
automated  manner  through  spreadsheets.  These  pose  risks  relating  to  data
integrity and reliability. Use of spreadsheets in this regard should be restricted
and should be replaced by appropriate IT applications within a definite time-
frame in a phased manner.

24. Banks  may  obtain  application  integrity  statements  in  writing  from  the
application system vendors providing for reasonable level of assurance about
the application being free of malware at the time of sale, free of any obvious
bugs,  and  free  of  any  covert  channels  in  the  code  (of  the  version  of  the
application being delivered as well as any subsequent versions/modifications
done).

25. For all critical applications, either the source code must be received from the
vendor or a software escrow agreement should be in place with a third party
to  ensure  source  code  availability  in  the  event  the  vendor  goes  out  of
business. It needs to be ensured that product updates and programme fixes
are also included in the escrow agreement.

26. Applications should be configured to logout the users after a specific period of
inactivity. The application must ensure rollover of incomplete transactions and
otherwise ensure integrity of data in case of a log out.

27. There  should  be  suitable  interface  controls  in  place.  Data  transfer  from  one
process to another or from one application to another, particularly for critical
systems,  should  not  have  any  manual  intervention  in  order  to  prevent  any
unauthorized modification. The process needs to be automated and properly
integrated  with  due  authentication  mechanism  and  audit  trails  by  enabling
“Straight  Through  Processing”  between  applications  or  from  data  sources  to
replace  any  manual  intervention/semi-automated  processes  like  extracting
data  in  text  files  and  uploading  to  the  target  system,  importing  to  a
spreadsheet, etc. Further, proper validations and reconciliation of data needs
to  be  carried  out  between  relevant  interfaces/applications  across  the  bank.
The  bank  needs  to  suitably  integrate  the  systems  and  applications,  as
required, to enhance data integrity and reliability.

28. Multi-tier  application  architecture  needs  to  be  considered  for  relevant  critical
systems  like  internet  banking  systems  which  differentiate  session  control,

P a g e  | 26

presentation  logic,  server  side  input  validation,  business  logic  and  database
access.

29. In  the  event  of  data  pertaining  to  Indian  operations  being  stored  and/or
processed abroad, for example, by foreign banks, there needs to be suitable
controls like segregation of data and strict access controls based on ‘need to
know’  and  robust  change  controls.  The  bank  should  be  in  a  position  to
adequately  prove  the  same  to  the  regulator.  Regulator’s  access  to  such
data/records  and  other  relevant  information  should  not  be  impeded  in  any
manner and RBI would have the right to cause an inspection to be made of
the processing centre/data centre and its books and accounts by one or more
of its officers or employees or other persons.

30. An  application  security  review/testing,  initially  and  during  major  changes,
needs  to  be  conducted  using  a  combination  of  source  code  review,  stress
loading, exception testing and compliance review to identify insecure coding
techniques and systems vulnerabilities to a reasonable extent.

31. Critical application system logs/audit trails also need to be backed up as part

of the application backup policy.

32. Robust  System  Security  Testing,  in  respect  of  critical  e-banking  systems,
needs to incorporate, inter-alia, specifications relating to information leakage,
business
input  data  validation,
exception/error  handling,  session  management,  cryptography  and  detailed
logging, as relevant.  These need to be carried out atleast on annual basis.

logic,  authentication,  authorization,

12) Migration controls:

(i)  There needs to be a documented Migration Policy indicating the requirement of road-
map / migration plan / methodology for data migration (which includes verification of
completeness,  consistency  and  integrity  of  the  migration  activity  and  pre  and  post
migration activities along with responsibilities and timelines for completion of same).
Explicit sign offs from users/application owners need to be obtained after each stage
of migration and after complete migration process. Audit trails need to be available to
document the conversion, including data mappings and transformations.

(ii)  The key aspects that are required to be considered include:

a.  Integrity  of  data—  indicating  that  the  data  is  not  altered  manually  or
electronically by a person, programme, substitution or overwriting in the new
system.  Integrity  thus,  includes  error  creep  due  to  factors  like  transposition,
transcription, etc.

b.  Completeness—  ensuring  that  the  total  number  of  records  from  the  source
database is transferred to the new database (assuming the number of fields is
the same)

c.  Confidentiality  of  data  under  conversion—ensuring  that  data  is  backed  up
before migration for future reference or any emergency that might arise out of
the data migration process

d.  Consistency  of  data—  the  field/record  called  for  from  the  new  application
should be consistent with that of the original application. This should enable
consistency in repeatability of the testing exercise

e.  Continuity—the  new  application  should  be  able  to  continue  with  newer
records as addition (or appendage) and help in ensuring seamless business
continuity

(iii) It  is  a  good  practice  that  the  last  copy  of  the  data  before  conversion  from  the  old
platform  and  the  first  copy  of  the  data  after  conversion  to  the  new  platform  are
maintained separately in the archive for any future reference.

P a g e  | 27

(iv) The error logs pertaining to the pre-migration/ migration/ post migration period along

with root cause analysis and action taken need to be available for review.

(v) Banks  may  need  to  migrate  the  complete  transaction  data  and  audit  trails  from  the
old system to the new system. Else, banks should have the capability to access the
older  transactional  data  and  piece  together  the  transaction  trail  between  older  and
newer systems, to satisfy any supervisory/legal requirements that may arise.

13) Implementation of new technologies:

(i)  Banks need to carry out due diligence with regard to new technologies since they can
potentially  introduce  additional  risk  exposures.  A  bank  needs  to  authorise  the  large
scale  use  and  deployment  in  production  environment  of  technologies  that  have
matured  to  a  state  where  there  is  a  generally  agreed  set  of  industry-accepted
controls  and  robust  diligence  and  testing  has  been  carried  out  to  ascertain  the
security  issues  of  the  technology  or  where  compensating  controls  are  sufficient  to
prevent  significant  impact  and  to  comply  with  the  institution’s  risk  appetite  and
regulatory expectations.

(ii)  Any  new  business  products  introduced    along  with  the  underlying  information
systems  need  to  be  assessed  as  part  of  a  formal  product  approval  process  which
incorporates,  inter-alia,  security  related  aspects  and  fulfilment  of  relevant  legal  and
regulatory prescriptions. A bank needs to develop an authorisation process involving
a risk assessment balancing the benefits of the new technology with the risk.

14) Encryption

(i)  Encryption Types:

Symmetric encryption is the use of the same key and algorithm by the creator and reader
of a file or message. The creator uses the key and algorithm to encrypt, and the reader uses
both to decrypt. Symmetric encryption relies on the secrecy of the key. If the key is captured
by an attacker, either when it is exchanged between the communicating parties, or while one
of  the  parties  uses  or  stores  the  key,  the  attacker  can  use  the  key  and  the  algorithm  to
decrypt messages or to masquerade as a message creator.
Asymmetric  encryption  lessens  the  risk  of  key  exposure  by  using  two  mathematically
related keys, the private key and the public key. When one key is used to encrypt, only the
other  key  can  decrypt.  Therefore,  only  one  key  (the  private  key)  must  be  kept  secret.  The
key  that  is  exchanged  (the  public  key)  poses  no  risk  if  it  becomes  known.  For  instance,  if
individual A has a private key and publishes the public key, individual B can obtain the public
key,  encrypt  a  message  to  individual  A,  and  send  it.  As  long  as  an  individual  keeps  his
private key secure from disclosure, only individual A will be able to decrypt the message.

(ii)   Typical  areas  or  situations  requiring  deployment  of  cryptographic  techniques,  given
the  risks  involved,  include  transmission  and  storage  of  critical  and/or  sensitive
data/information in an ‘un-trusted’ environment or where a higher degree of security
is  required,  generation  of  customer  PINs  which  are  typically  used  for  card
transactions  and  online  services,  detection  of  any  unauthorised  alteration  of
data/information  and  verification  of
transactions  or
data/information.

the  authenticity  of

(iii) Since security is primarily based on the encryption keys, effective key management is
crucial. Effective key management systems are based on an agreed set of standards,
procedures, and secure methods that address
a.  Generating keys for different cryptographic systems and different applications
b.  Generating  and  obtaining  public  keys  and  distributing  keys  to  intended  users,

including how keys should be activated when received

P a g e  | 28

c.  Storing keys, including how authorized users obtain access to keys and changing
or updating keys, including rules on when keys should be changed and how this
will be done

d.  Dealing  with  compromised  keys,  revoking  keys  and  specifying  how  keys  should

be withdrawn or deactivated

e.  Recovering  keys  that  are  lost  or  corrupted  as  part  of  business  continuity

management

f.  Archiving, destroying  keys
g.  Logging the auditing of key management-related activities
h.  Instituting defined activation and deactivation dates, limiting the usage period of

keys

(iv) Secure key management systems are characterized by the following precautions:

a.  Additional  physical  protection  of  equipment  used  to  generate,  store  and  archive

cryptographic keys

b.   Use of cryptographic techniques to maintain cryptographic key confidentiality
c.

 Segregation  of  duties,  with  no  single  individual  having  knowledge  of  the  entire
cryptographic  key  (i.e.  two-person  controls)  or  having  access  to  all  the
components making up these keys

d.  Ensuring  key  management  is  fully  automated  (e.g.,  personnel  do  not  have  the

opportunity to expose a key or influence the key creation)

e.  Ensuring no key ever appears unencrypted
f.  Ensuring  keys  are  randomly  chosen  from  the  entire  key  space,  preferably  by

hardware

g.  Ensuring key-encrypting keys are separate from data keys. No data ever appears
in clear text that was encrypted using a key-encrypting key. (A key encrypting key
is used to encrypt other keys, securing them from disclosure.)

h.  Make sure that keys with a long life are sparsely used. The more a key is used,

the greater the opportunity for an attacker to discover the key

i.  Ensuring keys are changed frequently.
j.  Ensuring keys that are transmitted are sent securely to well-authenticated parties.
k.  Ensuring  key-generating  equipment  is  physically  and  logically  secure  from
construction through receipt, installation, operation, and removal from service.

(v) Normally,  a  minimum  of  128-bit  SSL  encryption  is  expected.  Constant  advances  in
computer hardware, cryptanalysis and distributed brute force techniques may induce
use of larger key lengths periodically. It is expected that banks will properly evaluate
security  requirements  associated  with  their  internet  banking  systems  and  other
relevant  systems  and  adopt  an  encryption  solution  that  is  commensurate  with  the
degree  of  confidentiality  and  integrity  required.  Banks  should  only  select  encryption
algorithms  which  are  well  established  international  standards  and  which  have  been
subjected  to  rigorous  scrutiny  by  an  international  cryptographer  community  or
approved  by  authoritative  professional  bodies,  reputable  security  vendors  or
government agencies.

15) Data security

i.  Banks  need  to  define  and  implement  procedures  to  ensure  the  integrity  and
consistency of all data stored in electronic form, such as databases, data warehouses
and data archives.

ii.  A  data  security  theory  seeks  to  establish  uniform  risk-based  requirements  for  the
protection of data elements. To ensure that the protection is uniform within and outside
of the institution, tools such as data classifications and protection profiles can be used,
as indicated earlier in the chapter.

P a g e  | 29

iii.  Data classification and protection profiles are complex to implement when the network
or storage is viewed as a utility. Because of that complexity, some institutions treat all
information at that level as if it were of the highest sensitivity and implement encryption
as  a  protective  measure.  The  complexity  in  implementing  data  classification  in  other
layers or in other aspects of an institution’s operation may result in other risk mitigation
procedures being used. Adequacy is a function of the extent of risk mitigation, and not
the procedure or tool used to mitigate risk.

iv.   Policies  regarding  media  handling,  disposal,  and  transit  should  be  implemented  to
enable the use of protection profiles and otherwise mitigate risks to data. If protection
profiles  are  not  used,  the  policies  should  accomplish  the  same  goal  as  protection
profiles, which is to deliver the same degree of residual risk without regard to whether
the information is in transit or storage, who is directly controlling the data, or where the
storage may be.

v.  There  should  be  secure  storage  of  media.  Controls  could  include  physical  and
environmental controls such as fire and flood protection, limiting access by means like
physical  locks,  keypad,  passwords,  biometrics,  etc.,  labelling,  and  logged  access.
Management should establish access controls to limit access to media, while ensuring
that all employees have authorization to access the minimum data required to perform
their  responsibilities.  More  sensitive  information  such  as  system  documentation,
application source  code,  and  production  transaction  data  should  have  more  extensive
controls  to  guard  against  alteration  (e.g.,  integrity  checkers,  cryptographic  hashes).
Furthermore, policies should minimize the distribution of sensitive information, including
printouts  that  contain  the  information.  Periodically,  the  security  staff,  audit  staff,  and
data  owners  should  review  authorization  levels  and  distribution  lists  to  ensure  they
remain appropriate and current.

vi.  The  storage  of  data  in  portable  devices,  such  as  laptops  and  PDAs,  poses  unique
problems. Mitigation of those risks typically involves encryption of sensitive data, host-
provided access controls, etc.

vii.  Banks  need  appropriate  disposal  procedures  for  both  electronic  and  paper  based
media.  Contracts  with  third-party  disposal  firms  should  address  acceptable  disposal
procedures.  For  computer  media,  data  frequently  remains  on  media  after  erasure.
Since that data can be recovered, additional disposal techniques should be applied to
sensitive data like physical destruction, overwriting data, degaussing etc.

viii. Banks should maintain the security of media while in transit or when shared with third
parties.  Policies  should  include  contractual  requirements  that  incorporate  necessary
risk-based  controls,  restrictions  on  the  carriers  used  and  procedures  to  verify  the
identity of couriers.

ix.  Banks  should  encrypt  customer  account  and  transaction  data  which  is  transmitted,
transported,  delivered  or  couriered  to  external  parties  or  other  locations,  taking  into
account all intermediate junctures and transit points from source to destination.

x.  A  few  other  aspects  that  also  needs  to  be  considered  include  appropriate  blocking,
filtering  and  monitoring  of  electronic  mechanisms  like  e-mail  and  printing  and
monitoring  for  unauthorised  software  and  hardware  like  password  cracking  software,
key loggers, wireless access points, etc.

xi.  Concerns over the need to better control and protect sensitive information have given
rise  to  a  new  set  of  solutions  aimed  at  increasing  an  enterprise’s  ability  to  protect  its
information  assets.  These  solutions  vary  in  their  capabilities  and  methodologies,  but
collectively they have been placed in a category known as data leak prevention (DLP).
It  provides  a  comprehensive  approach  covering  people,  processes,  and  systems  that
identify, monitor, and protect data in use (e.g., endpoint actions), data in motion (e.g.,
network actions), and data at rest (e.g., data storage) through deep content inspection
and with a centralized management framework.
Most DLP solutions include a suite of technologies that facilitate three key objectives:

• Locate and catalogue sensitive information stored throughout the enterprise

P a g e  | 30

• Monitor and control the movement of sensitive information across enterprise
networks
• Monitor and control the movement of sensitive information on end-user systems

Banks may consider such solutions, if required, after assessing their potential to
improve data security.

16) Vulnerability Assessment

i.  Soon  after  new  vulnerabilities  are  discovered  and  reported  by  security  researchers  or
vendors,  attackers  engineer  the  malicious  exploit  code  and  then  launch  that  code
against targets of interest. Any significant delays in finding or fixing software with critical
vulnerabilities  provides  ample  opportunity  for  persistent  attackers  to  break  through,
gaining control  over  the  vulnerable machines  and  getting  access  to the  sensitive  data
they  contain.  Banks  that  do  not  scan  for  vulnerabilities  and  address  discovered  flaws
proactively face a significant likelihood of having their computer systems compromised.

ii.  The following are some of the measures suggested:

a.  Automated  vulnerability  scanning  tools  need  to  be  used  against  all  systems
on  their  networks  on  a  periodic  basis,  say  monthly  or  weekly  or  more
frequently.

credentials) at least quarterly, either with agents running locally on each end
system to analyze the security configuration or with remote scanners that are
given  administrative  rights  on  the  system  being  tested,  to  overcome
limitations of unauthenticated vulnerability scanning.

(i.e.,  configuring

is  performed

c.  Banks  should  compare  the  results  from  back-to-back  vulnerability  scans  to
verify  that  vulnerabilities  were  addressed  either by  patching,  implementing  a
compensating  control,  or  by  documenting  and  accepting  a  reasonable
business  risk.  Such  acceptance  of  business  risks  for  existing  vulnerabilities
should be periodically reviewed to determine if newer compensating controls
or  subsequent  patches  can  address  vulnerabilities  that  were  previously
accepted, or if conditions have changed increasing the risk.

d.  Vulnerability  scanning  tools  should  be  tuned  to  compare  services  that  are
listening  on  each  machine  against  a  list  of  authorized  services.  The  tools
should  be  further  tuned  to  identify  changes  over  time  on  systems  for  both
authorized and unauthorized services.

e.  The  security  function  should  have  updated  status  regarding  numbers  of
unmitigated,  critical  vulnerabilities,  for  each  department/division,  plan  for
mitigation  and should share vulnerability reports indicating critical issues with
senior management to provide effective incentives for mitigation.

17) Establishing on-going security monitoring processes

i.  A  bank  needs  to  have  robust  monitoring  processes  in  place  to  identify  events  and
unusual activity patterns that could impact on the security of IT assets. The strength of
the monitoring controls needs to be proportionate to the criticality of an IT asset. Alerts
would  need  to  be  investigated  in  a  timely  manner,  with  an  appropriate  response
determined.

ii.  Common  monitoring  processes  include  activity  logging  (including  exceptions  to
approved activity), for example, device, server, network activity, security sensor alerts;
monitoring  staff  or  third-party  access  to  sensitive  data/information  to  ensure  it  is  for  a
valid  business  reason,  scanning  host  systems  for  known  vulnerabilities,  checks  to
determine  if  information  security  controls  are  operating  as  expected  and  are  being

P a g e  | 31

complied with, checking whether powerful utilities / commands have been disabled on
attached hosts by using tools like ‘network sniffer’), environment and customer profiling,
checking  for  the  existence  and  configuration  of  unauthorised    wireless  networks  by
using  automated  tools,  discovering  the  existence  of  unauthorised  systems  by  using
network discovery and mapping tools  and detecting unauthorised changes to electronic
documents and configuration files by using file integrity monitoring software.

iii.  Banks’  networks  should  be  designed

to  support  effective  monitoring.  Design
considerations include network traffic policies that address the allowed communications
between  computers  or  groups  of  computers,  security  domains  that  implement  the
policies, sensor placement to identify policy violations and anomalous traffic, nature and
extent of logging, log storage and protection and ability to implement additional sensors
on an ad hoc basis when required.

iv.  Banks would need to establish a clear allocation of responsibility for regular monitoring,
and  the  processes  and  tools  in  this  regard  should  be  in  a  position  to  manage  the
volume  of  monitoring  required,  thereby  reducing  the  risk  of  an  incident  going
undetected.

v.  Highly sensitive and/or critical IT assets would need to have logging enabled to record

events and monitored at a level proportional to the level of risk.

vi.  Users, like system administrators, with elevated access privileges should be subjected

to a greater level of monitoring in light of the heightened risks involved.

vii.  The  integrity  of  the  monitoring  logs  and  processes  should  be  safeguarded  through

appropriate access controls and segregation of duties.

viii. Banks  should  frequently  review  all  system  accounts  and  disable  any  account  that
cannot be associated with a business process and business owner. Reports that may
be generated from systems and reviewed frequently may include, among others, a list
of  locked  out  accounts,  disabled  accounts,  accounts  with  passwords  that  exceed  the
maximum password age, and accounts with passwords that never expire.

ix.  Banks  should  establish  and  follow  a  process  for  revoking  system  access  by  disabling

accounts immediately upon termination of an employee or contractor.

x.  Banks should regularly monitor the use of all accounts, automatically logging off users

after a standard period of inactivity.

xi.  Banks  should  monitor  account  usage  to  determine  dormant  accounts  that  have  not
been used for a given period, say 15 days, notifying the user or user’s manager of the
dormancy. After a longer period, say 30 days, the account may be disabled.

xii.  On  a  periodic  basis,  say  monthly  or  quarterly  basis,  banks  should  require  that
managers  match  active  employees  and  contractors  with  each  account  belonging  to
their  managed  staff.  Security/system  administrators  should  then  disable  accounts  that
are not assigned to active employees or contractors.

xiii. Banks should monitor attempts to access deactivated accounts through audit logging.
xiv. Banks  should  validate  audit  log  settings  for  each  hardware  device  and  the  software
installed  on  it,  ensuring  that  logs  include  a  date,  timestamp,  source  addresses,
destination  addresses,  and  various  other  useful  elements  of  each  packet  and/or
transaction.  Systems  should  record  logs  in  a  standardized  format  such  as  syslog
entries. If systems cannot generate logs in a standardized format, banks need to deploy
log normalization tools to convert logs into a standardized format.

xv. System  administrators  and  information  security  personnel  should  consider  devising
profiles of common events from given systems, so that they can tune detection to focus
on  unusual  activity,  reducing  false  positives,  more  rapidly  identify  anomalies,  and
prevent overwhelming the analysts with insignificant alerts.

xvi. The following technologies/factors provide capabilities for effective attack detection and

analysis:

a.  Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) - SIEM products provide
situational  awareness  through  the  collection,  aggregation,  correlation  and
analysis of disparate data from various sources.  The information provided by
these tools help in understanding the scope of an incident.

P a g e  | 32

b.  Intrusion Detection and Prevention System (IDS and IPS) - IPS products that
have detection capabilities should be fully used during an incident to limit any
further  impact  on  the  organization.    IDS  and  IPS  products  are  often  the
primary source of information leading to the identification of an attack.  Once
the  attack  has  been  identified,  it  is  essential  to  enable  the  appropriate  IPS
rule sets to block further incident propagation and to support containment and
eradication.

c.  Network  Behaviour  Analysis  (NBA)  -  Network  wide  anomaly-detection  tools
will provide data on traffic patterns that are indicative of an incident.  Once an
incident has been identified through the use of these tools, it is important to
capture  that  information  for  the  purposes  of  supporting  further  mitigation
activities,  including  operational  workflow  to  ensure  that  the  information  from
these tools is routed to the appropriate response team.

d.  Managed  Security  Service  Provider  (MSSP)  -  If  an  organization  has
outsourced security event management to an MSSP, the latter should provide
notification when an incident requires attention.  Organisation must obtain as
much  information  on  the  incident  as  possible  from  MSSP  and  implement
remediation steps as recommended by MSSP.

xvii.  Banks  also  need  to  pro-actively  monitor  various  authentic  sources  like  CERT-In,
security  vendors,  etc.  for  any  security  related  advisories  and  take  suitable  measures
accordingly.

18) Security measures against Malware:

i.  Malicious  software  is  an  integral  and  a  dangerous  aspect  of  internet  based  threats
which  target  end-users  and  organizations  through  modes  like  web  browsing,  email
attachments,  mobile  devices,  and  other  vectors.  Malicious  code  may  tamper  with  a
system's  contents,  and  capture  sensitive  data.  It  can  also  spread  to  other  systems.
Modern  malware  aims  to  avoid  signature-based  and  behavioral  detection,  and  may
disable  anti-virus  tools  running  on  the  targeted  system.  Anti-virus  and  anti-spyware
software,  collectively  referred  to  as  anti-malware  tools,  help  defend  against  these
threats by attempting to detect malware and block their execution.

(cid:190)  At  host

level:  The  various  measures  at

ii.  Typical  controls  to  protect  against  malicious  code  use  layered  combinations  of
technology, policies and procedures and training. The controls are of the preventive and
detective/corrective in nature. Controls are applied at the host, network, and user levels:
include  host
hardening(including  patch  application  and  proper  security  configurations  of  the
operating  system  (OS),  browsers,  and  other  network-aware  software),  considering
implementing host-based firewalls on each internal computer and especially laptops
assigned  to  mobile  users.  Many  host-based  firewalls  also  have  application  hashing
capabilities,  which  are  helpful  in  identifying  applications  that  may  have  been
trojanized  after  initial  installation,    considering  host  IPS  and  integrity  checking
software  combined  with  strict  change  controls  and  configuration  management,
periodic auditing of host configurations, both manual and automated.

level

(cid:190)  At  network  level:  The  various  measures  include  limiting  the  transfer  of  executable
files  through  the  perimeter,  IDS  and  IPS  monitoring  of  incoming  and  outgoing
network  traffic,  including  anti-virus,  anti-spyware  and  signature  and  anomaly-based
traffic monitors, routing Access Control Lists(ACLs) that limit incoming and outgoing
connections  as  well  as  internal  connections  to  those  necessary  for  business
purposes, proxy servers that inspect incoming and outgoing packets for indicators of
malicious  code  and  block  access  to  known  or  suspected  malware  distribution
servers,  filtering  to  protect  against  attacks  such  as  cross-site  scripting  and  SQL
injection.

(cid:190)  At  user  level:  User  education  in  awareness,  safe  computing  practices,  indicators  of

malicious code, and response actions.

P a g e  | 33

iii.  Enterprise  security  administrative  features  may  be  used  daily  to  check  the  number  of
systems  that  do  not  have  the  latest  anti-malware  signatures.  All  malware  detection
events  should  be  sent  to  enterprise  anti-malware  administration  tools  and  event  log
servers.

iv.  Banks  should  employ  anti-malware  software  and  signature  auto  update  features  to
automatically  update  signature  files  and  scan  engines  whenever  the  vendor  publishes
updates. After applying an update, automated systems should verify that each system
has  received  its  signature  update.  The  bank  should  monitor  anti-virus  console  logs  to
correct any systems that failed to be updated. The systems deployed for client security
should  be  delivering  simplified  administration  through  central  management  and
providing  critical  visibility  into  threats  and  vulnerabilities.  It  should  also  integrate  with
existing  infrastructure  software,  such  as  Active  Directory  for  enhanced  protection  and
greater control.

v.  Administrators should not rely solely on AV software and email filtering to detect worm
infections. Logs from firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention sensors, DNS servers
and proxy server logs should be monitored on a daily basis for signs of worm infections
including but not limited to:

(cid:190)  Outbound  SMTP  connection  attempts  from  anything  other  than  a  bank’s

SMTP mail gateways

(cid:190)  Excessive or unusual scanning on TCP and UDP ports 135-139 and 445
(cid:190)  Connection  attempts  on  IRC  or  any  other  ports  that  are  unusual  for  the

environment

(cid:190)  Excessive attempts from internal systems to access non-business web sites
(cid:190)  Excessive traffic from individual or a group of internal systems
(cid:190)  Excessive DNS queries from internal systems to the same host name and for
known “nonexistent” host names. Using a centralized means such as a syslog
host to collect logs from various devices and systems can help in the analysis
of the information

vi.  Banks  should configure laptops, workstations, and servers so that they do not auto-run
content  from  USB  tokens,  USB  hard  drives,  CDs/DVDs,  external  SATA  devices,
mounted network shares, or other removable media.

vii.  Banks should configure systems so that they conduct an automated antimalware scan

of removable media when it is inserted.

viii. Banks can also consider deploying the Network Access Control (NAC) tools to verify
security configuration and patch level compliance of devices before granting access to
a network. Network Admission Control (NAC) restricts access to the network based on
the  identity  or  security  posture  of  an  organization.  When  NAC  is  implemented,  it  will
force  a  user  or  a  machine  seeking  network  access  for  authentication  prior  to  granting
actual  access  to  the  network.  A  typical  (non-free)  WiFi  connection  is  a  form  of  NAC.
The user must present some sort of credentials (or a credit card) before being granted
access  to  the  network.  The  network  admission  control  systems  allow  noncompliant
devices to be denied access, placed in a quarantined area, or given restricted access to
computing resources, thus keeping insecure nodes from infecting the network. The key
component of the Network Admission Control program is the Trust Agent, which resides
on an endpoint system and communicates with routers on the network. The information
is  then  relayed  to  a  Secure  Access  Control  Server  (ACS)  where  access  control
decisions  are  made.  The  ACS  directs  the  router  to  perform  enforcement  against  the
endpoint.

ix.  Email Attachment Filtering - Banks should filter various attachment types at the email
gateway, unless required for specific business use. Some examples include .ade .cmd
.eml .ins .mdb .mst .reg .url .wsf .adp .com .exe .isp .mde .pcd .scr .vb .wsh .bas .cpl
.hlp .js .msc .pif .sct .vbe .bat .crt .hta .jse .msi .pl .scx .vbs .chm .dll .inf.lnk .msp .pot
.shs .wsc… etc. Banks should consider only allowing file extensions with a documented
business case and filtering all others.

19) Patch Management:

i.  A  Patch  Management  process  needs  to  be  in  place  to  address  technical  system  and
software  vulnerabilities  quickly  and  effectively  in  order  to  reduce  the  likelihood  of  a
serious business impact arising.

ii.  There  should  be  documented  standards  /  procedures  for  patch  management.  The
standards  /  procedures  for  patch  management  should  include  a  method  of  defining
roles  and  responsibilities  for  patch  management,  determining  the  importance  of
systems (for e.g., based on the information handled, the business processes supported
and  the  environments  in  which  they  are  used)  ,  recording  patches  that  have  been
applied (for e.g., using an inventory of computer assets including their patch level).

iii.  The patch management process should include aspects like:

a.  Determining methods of obtaining and validating patches  for ensuring that

the patch is from an authorised source

b.  Identifying vulnerabilities that are applicable to applications and systems used

by the organisation

c.  Assessing the business impact of implementing patches (or not implementing

a particular patch)

d.  Ensuring patches are tested
e.  Describing methods of deploying patches, for example, through automated

manner

f.  Reporting on the status of patch deployment across the organisation
g.  Including methods of dealing with the failed deployment of a patch (e.g.,

redeployment of the patch).

iv.  Methods  should  be  established  to  protect  information  and  systems  if  no  patch  is
available  for  an  identified  vulnerability,  for  example,  disabling  services  and  adding
additional access controls.Organizations should deploy automated patch management
tools  and  software  update  tools  for  all systems  for  which such  tools  are  available and
safe.

v.  Organizations should measure the delay in patching new vulnerabilities and ensure the
delay is not beyond the benchmarks set forth by the organization, which should be less
for  critical  patches,  say  not  more  than  a  week,  unless  a  mitigating  control  that  blocks
exploitation is available.

vi.  Critical  patches  must  be  evaluated  in  a  test  environment  before  being  updated  into
production  on  enterprise  systems.  If  such  patches  break  critical  business  applications
on  test  machines,  the  organization  must  devise  other  mitigating  controls  that  block
exploitation on systems where the patch is difficult to be deployed because of its impact
on business functionality.

20) Change Management:

i.  A  change  management  process  should  be  established,  which  covers  all  types  of
change.  For  example,  upgrades  and  modifications  to  application  and  software,
modifications to business information, emergency ‘fixes’, and changes to the computers
/ networks that support the application.

ii.  The  change  management  process should  be  documented,  and  include  approving  and
testing  changes  to  ensure  that  they  do  not  compromise  security  controls,  performing
changes  and  signing  them  off  to  ensure  they  are  made  correctly  and  securely,
reviewing  completed  changes  to  ensure  that  no  unauthorised  changes  have  been
made.

P a g e  | 35

iii.  The  following  steps  should  be  taken  prior  to  changes  being  applied  to  the  live

environment:
(cid:190) Change  requests  should  be  documented  (e.g.,  on  a  change  request  form)  and
accepted  only  from  authorised  individuals  and  changes  should  be  approved  by  an
appropriate authority

(cid:190) The potential business impacts of changes should be assessed (for e.g., in terms of

the overall risk and impact on other components of the application)

(cid:190) Changes should be tested to help determine the expected results (for e.g., deploying

the patch into the live environment)

(cid:190) Changes should be reviewed to ensure that they do not compromise security controls
(e.g., by checking software to ensure it does not contain malicious code, such as a
trojan horse or a virus)

(cid:190) Back-out  positions  should  be  established  so  that  the  application  can  recover  from

failed changes or unexpected results

iv.  Changes  to  the  application  should  be  performed  by  skilled  and  competent  individuals
who  are  capable  of  making  changes  correctly  and  securely  and  signed  off  by  an
appropriate business official.

21) Audit trails

i.  Banks needs to ensure that audit trails exist for IT assets satisfying the banks business
requirements  including  regulatory  and  legal  requirements,  facilitating  audit,  serving  as
forensic evidence when required and assisting in dispute resolution.  This could include,
as applicable, various areas like transaction with financial consequences, the opening,
modifications  or  closing  of  customer  accounts,  modifications  in  sensitive  master  data,
accessing  or  copying  of  sensitive  data/information;  and  granting,  modification  or
revocation of systems access rights or privileges for accessing sensitive IT assets.
ii.  Audit  trails  should  be  secured  to  ensure  the  integrity  of  the  information  captured,
including  the  preservation  of  evidence.  Retention  of  audit  trails  should  be  in  line  with
business, regulatory and legal requirements.

iii.  Some considerations for securing the integrity of log files include :

a.  Encrypting log files that contain sensitive data or that are transmitting over the

network

b.  Ensuring adequate storage capacity to avoid gaps in data gathering
c.  Securing back-up and disposal of log files
d.  Logging  the  data  to  write-only  media  like  a  write-once/read-many  (WORM)

disk or drive

e.  Setting  logging  parameters  to  disallow  any  modification  to  previously  written

data

iv.  As indicated earlier, network and host activities typically are recorded on the host and
sent across the network to a central logging facility which may process the logging data
into a common format. The process, called normalization, enables timely and effective
log analysis.

v.  Other aspects related to logging to be considered include:

a.  All  remote  access  to  an  internal  network,  whether  through  VPN,  dial-up,  or

other mechanism, should be logged verbosely

b.  Operating  systems  should  be  configured  to  log  access  control  events
associated with a user attempting to access a resource like a file or directory
without the appropriate permissions

c.  Security  personnel  and/or  administrators    designated  in  this  regard  should
identify  anomalies  in  logs  and  actively  review  the  anomalies,  documenting
their findings on an ongoing basis

P a g e  | 36

d.  Each bank can consider at least two synchronized time sources are available
in  their  network  from  which  all  servers  and  network  equipment  retrieve  time
information on a regular basis, so that timestamps in logs are consistent

e.  Network  boundary  devices,  including  firewalls,  network-based  IPSs,  and
inbound  and  outbound  proxies  may  be  configured  to  log  verbosely  all  traffic
(both allowed and blocked) arriving at the device

vi.  Given  the  multiplicity  of  devices  and  systems,  banks  should  consider  deploying  a
Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system tool for log aggregation
and consolidation from multiple machines/systems and for log correlation and analysis,
as  indicated  earlier  in  the  chapter.  Furthermore,  event  logs  may  be  correlated  with
information from vulnerability scans to fulfill two goals. First, personnel should verify that
the  activity  of  the  regular  vulnerability  scanning  tools  themselves  is  logged.  And,
secondly,  personnel  should  be  able  to  correlate  attack  detection  events  with  earlier
vulnerability scanning results to determine whether the given exploit was used against a
known-vulnerable target.

vii.  E-banking systems should be designed and installed to capture and maintain forensic
evidence in a manner that maintains control over the evidence, and prevents tampering
and the collection of false evidence.

viii. In instances where processing systems and related audit trails are the responsibility of
a  third-party  service  provider,  the  bank  should  ensure  that  it  has  access  to  relevant
audit  trails  maintained  by  the  service  provider  apart  from  ensuring  that  the  audit  trails
maintained by the service provider meet the bank's standards.

22) Information security reporting and metrics

i.  Security  monitoring  arrangements  should  provide  key  decision-makers  and  Senior
Management/Board of Directors with an informed view of aspects like the effectiveness
and  efficiency  of  information  security  arrangements,    areas  where  improvement  is
required,  information  and  systems  that  are  subject  to  an  unacceptable  level  of  risk,
performance  against  quantitative,  objective  targets,  actions  required  to  help  minimize
risk  (e.g.,  reviewing  the  organization’s  risk  appetite,  understanding  the  information
security  threat  environment  and  encouraging  business  and  system  owners  to  remedy
unacceptable risks).

ii.  There  should  be  arrangements  for  monitoring  the  information  security  condition  of  the
organisation,  which  are  documented,  agreed  with  top  management  and  performed
regularly. Information generated by monitoring the information security condition of the
organization  should  be  used  to  measure  the  effectiveness  of  the  information  security
strategy, information security policy and security architecture.

iii.  Analysis  performed  as  part  of  security  monitoring  and  reporting  arrangement  may

include, inter-alia, the following:

(cid:190)  Details relating to information security incidents and their impact
(cid:190)  Steps taken for non-recurrence of such events in the future
(cid:190)  Major

Internal  and  external  audit/vulnerability  assessment/penetration

test

findings and remediation status

(cid:190)  Operational  security  statistics,  such  as  firewall  log  data,  patch  management

details and number of spam e-mails

(cid:190)  Costs  associated  with  financial  losses,  legal  or  regulatory  penalties  and  risk

profile(s)

(cid:190)  Progress against security plans/strategy
(cid:190)  Capacity and performance analysis of security systems
(cid:190)
(cid:190)  Fraud analysis

Infrastructure and software analysis

P a g e  | 37

iv.  Information collected as part of security reporting arrangements should include details
about all aspects of information risk like criticality of information, identified vulnerabilities
and  level  of  threats,  potential  business  impacts  and  the  status  of  security  controls  in
place. Information about the security condition of the organisation should be provided to
key  decision-makers/stake  holders  like  the  Board,  top  management,  members  of
Information Security Committee, and relevant external bodies like regulator as required.
v.  Metrics  can  be  an  effective  tool  for  security  managers  to  discern  the  effectiveness  of
various  components  of  their  security  policy  and  programs,  the  security  of  a  specific
system,  product  or  process,  effectiveness  and  efficiency  of  security  services  delivery,
the  impact  of  security  events  on  business  processes  and  the  ability  of  staff  or
departments  within  an  organization  to  address  security  issues  for  which  they  are
responsible.  Additionally,  they  may  be  used  to  raise  the  level  of  security  awareness
within  the  organization.  The  measurement  of  security  characteristics  can  allow
management  to  increase  control  and  drive  further  improvements  to  the  security
procedures and processes.

vi.  Each dimension of the IT security risk management framework can be measured by at
least  one  metric  to  enable  the  monitoring  of  progress  towards  set  targets  and  the
identification  of  trends.  The  use  of  metrics  needs  to  be  targeted  towards  the  areas  of
greatest  criticality.  Generally,  it  is  suggested  that  effective  metrics  need  to  follow  the
SMART acronym i.e. specific, measurable, attainable, repeatable and time-dependent.
vii.  In  addition,  a  comprehensive  set  of  metrics  that  provide  for  prospective  and
retrospective measures, like key performance indicators and key risk indicators, can be
devised.

viii. The  efficacy  of  a  security  metrics  system  in  mitigating  risk  depends  on  completeness
and  accuracy  of  the  measurements  and  their  effective  analysis.  The  measurements
should be reliable and sufficient to justify security decisions that affect the institution’s
security  posture,  allocate  resources  to  security-related  tasks,  and  provide  a  basis  for
security-related reports.

ix.  Some illustrative metrics include coverage of anti-malware software and their updation
percentage,  patch  latency,  extent  of  user  awareness  training,  vulnerability  related
metrics, etc.

23) Information security and Critical service providers/vendors

i.  Banks use third-party service providers in a variety of different capacities. It can be an
Internet service provider (ISP), application or managed service provider (ASP/MSP) or
business  service  provider  (BSP).  These  providers  may  often  perform  important
functions  for  the  bank  and  usually  may  require  access  to  confidential  information,
applications and systems.

ii.  When  enterprises  use  third  parties,  they  can  become  a  key  component  in  an
enterprise’s  controls  and  its  achievement  of  related  control  objectives.  Management
should evaluate the role that the third party performs in relation to the IT environment,
related controls and control objectives.

iii.  The  effectiveness  of  third-party  controls  can  enhance  the  ability  of  an  enterprise  to
achieve  its  control  objectives.  Conversely,  ineffective  third-party  controls  can  weaken
the ability of a bank to achieve its control objectives. These weaknesses can arise from
many sources including gaps in the control environment arising from the outsourcing of
services to the third party, poor control design, causing controls to operate ineffectively,
lack  of  knowledge  and/or  inexperience  of  personnel  responsible  for  control  functions
and  over-reliance  on  the  third  party’s  controls  (when  there  are  no  compensating
controls within the enterprise).

iv.  Third-party  providers  can  affect  an  enterprise  (including  its  partners),  its  processes,
controls  and  control  objectives  on  many  different  levels.  This  includes  effects  arising
from  such  things  as  economic  viability  of  the  third-party  provider,  third-party  provider

P a g e  | 38

access  to  information  that  is  transmitted  through  their  communication  systems  and
applications,  systems  and  application  availability,  processing  integrity,  application
development  and  change  management  processes  and    the  protection of  systems  and
information assets through backup recovery, contingency planning and redundancy.
v.  The  lack  of  controls  and/or  weakness  in  their  design,  operation  or  effectiveness  can
lead  to  consequences  like  loss  of  information  confidentiality  and  privacy,  systems  not
being  available  for  use  when  needed,  unauthorized  access  and  changes  to  systems,
applications  or  data,  changes  to  systems,  applications  or  data  occurring  that  result  in
system or security failures, loss of data, loss of data integrity, loss of data protection, or
system unavailability, loss of system resources and/or information assets and Increased
costs incurred by the enterprise as a result of any of the above.

vi.  The  relationship  between  the  enterprise  and  a  third-party  provider  should  be
documented in the form of an executed contract.  The various details and requirements
on the matter are covered under chapter on “IT outsourcing”.

24) Network Security

i.  Protection against growing cyber threats requires multiple layers of defenses, known as
defense  in  depth.  As  every  organization  is  different,  this  strategy  should  therefore  be
based on a balance between protection, capability, cost, performance, and operational
considerations.  Defense  in  depth  for  most  organizations  should  at  least  consider  the
following two areas:
(a) Protecting the enclave boundaries or perimeter
(b) Protecting the computing environment.

ii.  The enclave boundary is the point at which the organization’s network interacts with the
Internet. To control the flow of traffic through network borders and to police its content
looking for attacks and evidence of compromised machines, boundary defenses should
be  multi-layered,  relying  on  firewalls,  proxies,  DMZ  perimeter  networks,  and  network-
based Intrusion Prevention Systems and Intrusion Detection Systems.

iii.  It  should  be  noted  that  boundary  lines  between  internal  and  external  networks  are
diminishing  through  increased  interconnectivity  within  and  between  organizations  and
use of wireless systems. These blurring lines sometimes allow attackers to gain access
inside  networks  while  bypassing  boundary  systems.  However,  even  with  this  blurring,
effective  security  deployment  still  rely  on  carefully  configured  boundary  defenses  that
separate  networks  with  different  threat  levels,  different  sets  of  users,  and  different
levels  of  control.  Effective  multi-layered  defenses  of  perimeter  networks  help  to  lower
the number of successful attacks, allowing security personnel to focus on attackers who
have devised methods to bypass boundary restrictions.

iv.  An  effective  approach  to  securing  a  large  network  involves  dividing  the  network  into
logical  security  domains.  A  logical  security  domain  is  a  distinct  part  of  a  network  with
security policies that differ from other domains and perimeter controls enforcing access
at  a  network  level.  The  differences  may  be  far  broader  than  network  controls,
encompassing personnel, host, and other issues. Before establishing security domains,
banks need to map and configure the network to identify and control all access points.
Network configuration considerations could include the following actions:

(cid:190)
(cid:190)

 Identifying the various applications and systems accessed via the network
 Identifying  all  access  points  to  the  network  including  various  telecommunications
channels like ethernet, wireless, frame relay, dedicated lines, remote dial-up access,
extranets, internet

(cid:190)  Mapping the internal and external connectivity between various network segments
(cid:190)  Defining minimum access requirements for network services
(cid:190)  Determining the most appropriate network configuration to ensure adequate security

and performance for the bank

P a g e  | 39

v.  With  a  clear  understanding  of  network  connectivity,  banks  can  avoid  introducing
security  vulnerabilities  by  minimizing  access  to  less-trusted  domains  and  employing
encryption  and  other  controls  for  less  secure  connections.  Banks  can  then  determine
the most effective deployment of protocols, filtering routers, firewalls, gateways, proxy
servers,  and/or  physical  isolation  to  restrict  access.  Some  applications  and  business
processes may require complete segregation from the corporate network, for example,
preventing  connectivity  between  corporate  network  and  wire  transfer  system.  Others
may restrict access by placing the services that must be accessed by each zone in their
own security domain, commonly called a De-Militarized Zone.

vi.  Security  domains  are  bounded  by  perimeters.  Typical  perimeter  controls  include
firewalls  that  operate  at  different  network  layers,  malicious code  prevention,  outbound
filtering,  intrusion  detection  and  prevention  devices,  and  controls  over  infrastructure
services  such  as  DNS.  The  perimeter  controls  may  exist  on  separate  devices  or  be
combined  or  consolidated  on  one  or  more  devices.  Consolidation  on  a  single  device
could  improve  security  by  reducing  administrative  overhead.  However,  consolidation
may  increase  risk  through  a  reduced  ability  to  perform  certain  functions  and  the
existence of a single point of failure.

vii.  A few network protection devices are briefly explained as under:

a)  Firewalls: The main purpose of a firewall is access control. By limiting inbound (from the
Internet to the internal network) and outbound communications (from the internal network
to the Internet), various attack vectors can be reduced. Firewalls may provide additional
services like Network Address Translation and Virtual Private Network Gateway.
Financial  institutions  have  four  primary  firewall  types  from  which  to  choose:  packet
filtering,  stateful  inspection,  proxy  servers,  and  application-level  firewalls.  Any
product  may  have  characteristics  of  one  or  more  firewall  types.  The  selection  of  a
firewall type is dependent on many characteristics of the security zone, such as the
amount of traffic, the sensitivity of the systems and data, and applications.

Packet Filter Firewalls
Packet filter firewalls evaluate the headers of each incoming and outgoing packet to ensure
it has a valid internal address, originates from a permitted external address, connects to an
authorized  protocol  or  service,  and  contains  valid  basic  header  instructions.  If  the  packet
does not match the pre-defined policy for allowed traffic, then the firewall drops the packet.
Packet filters generally do not analyze the packet contents beyond the header information.
Among  the  major  weaknesses  associated  with  packet  filtering  firewalls  include  inability  to
prevent  attacks  that  exploit  application-specific  vulnerabilities  and  functions  because  the
packet  filter  does  not  examine  packet  contents  and  logging  functionality  is  limited  to  the
same information used to make access control decisions.

Stateful Inspection Firewalls
Stateful inspection firewalls are packet filters that monitor the state of the TCP connection.
Each TCP session starts with an initial “handshake” communicated through TCP flags in the
header  information.  When  a  connection  is  established  the  firewall  adds  the  connection
information  to  a  table.  The  firewall  can  then  compare  future  packets  to  the  connection  or
state  table.  This  essentially  verifies  that  inbound  traffic  is  in  response  to  requests  initiated
from inside the firewall.

Proxy Server Firewalls
Proxy servers act as an intermediary between internal and external IP addresses and block
direct  access  to  the  internal  network.  Essentially,  they  rewrite  packet  headers  to  substitute
the IP of the proxy server for the IP of the internal machine and forward packets to and from
the  internal  and  external  machines.  Due  to  that  limited  capability,  proxy  servers  are
commonly  employed  behind  other  firewall  devices.  The  primary  firewall  receives  all  traffic,
determines  which  application  is  being  targeted,  and  hands  off  the  traffic  to  the  appropriate

P a g e  | 40

proxy  server.  Common  proxy  servers  are  the  domain  name  server  (DNS),  Web  server
(HTTP),  and  mail  (SMTP)  server.  Proxy  servers  frequently  cache  requests  and  responses,
providing potential performance benefits. Additionally, proxy servers provide another layer of
access control by segregating the flow of Internet traffic to support additional authentication
and  logging  capability,  as  well  as  content  filtering.  Web  and  e-mail  proxy  servers,  for
example,  are  capable  of  filtering  for  potential  malicious  code  and  application-specific
commands.  Proxy  servers  are  increasing  in  importance  as  protocols  are  tunnelled  through
other protocols.

Application-Level Firewalls
Application-level firewalls perform application-level screening, typically including the filtering
capabilities of packet filter firewalls with additional validation of the packet content based on
the application. Application-level firewalls capture and compare packets to state information
in the connection tables. Unlike a packet filter firewall, an application level firewall continues
to examine each packet after the initial connection is established for specific application or
services  such  as  telnet,  FTP,  SMTP,  etc.  The  application-  level  firewall  can  provide
additional  screening  of  the  packet  payload  for  commands,  protocols,  packet  length,
authorization,  content,  or  invalid  headers.  Application  level  firewalls  provide  the  strongest
level of security.

Firewall Policy
A firewall policy states management’s expectation for how the firewall should function and is
a  component  of
inbound
communication types for the organization need to be explicitly defined in the firewall policies.
As the firewall is usually one of the first lines of defense, access to the firewall device itself
needs to be strictly controlled.

framework.  Acceptable

At  a  minimum,  the  policy  should  address  various  aspects  like  Firewall  topology  and
architecture  and  type  of  firewalls  being  utilized,  physical  placement  of  the  firewall
components,  permissible
  updating,
coordination with security monitoring and intrusion response mechanisms, responsibility for
monitoring  and  enforcing  the  firewall  policy,  protocols  and  applications  permitted,  regular
auditing  of  a  firewall’s  configuration  and  testing  of  the  firewall’s  effectiveness,  and
contingency planning.

Firewalls should not be relied upon, however, to provide full protection from attacks. Banks
should  complement  firewalls  with  strong  security  policies  and  a  range  of  other  controls.  In
fact, firewalls are potentially vulnerable to attacks including  spoofing trusted IP addresses,
denial of service by overloading the firewall with excessive requests or malformed packets,
sniffing  of  data  that  is  being  transmitted  outside  the  network,  hostile  code  embedded  in
legitimate  HTTP,  SMTP,  or  other  traffic  that  meet  all  firewall  rules,  etc.  Banks  can  reduce
their  vulnerability  to  these  attacks  through  network  configuration  and  design,  sound
implementation  of  its  firewall  architecture  that  includes  multiple  filter  points,  active  firewall
monitoring and management, and integrated security monitoring. In many cases, additional
access  controls  within  the  operating  system  or  application  will  provide  additional  means  of
defense.

Given  the  importance  of  firewalls  as  a  means  of  access  control,  good  firewall  related
practices include:

(cid:190)  Using a rule set that disallows all inbound and outbound traffic that is not specifically

allowed

(cid:190)  Using NAT and split DNS to hide internal system names and addresses from external

networks

(cid:190)  Using proxy connections for outbound HTTP connections and filtering malicious code

P a g e  | 41

(cid:190)  Hardening  the  firewall  by  removing  all  unnecessary  services  and  appropriately

patching, enhancing, and maintaining all software on the firewall unit

(cid:190)  Restricting  network  mapping  capabilities  through  the  firewall,  primarily  by  blocking

inbound ICMP (Internet Control Messaging Protocol) traffic

(cid:190)  Backing up firewalls to internal media and not backing up the firewall to servers on

protected networks

(cid:190)  Logging activity, with daily administrator review and limiting administrative access to

few individuals

(cid:190)  Using security monitoring devices and practices to monitor actions on the firewall and

to monitor communications allowed through the firewall

(cid:190)  Administering the firewall using encrypted communications and strong authentication,
accessing  the  firewall  only  from  secure  devices,  and  monitoring  all  administrative
access

(cid:190)  Making changes only through well-administered change control procedures.

times,

The firewall also needs to be configured for authorized outbound network traffic. In the case
of  a  compromised  host  inside  the  network,  outbound  or  egress  filtering  can  contain  that
system and prevent it from communicating outbound to their controller – as in the case with
botnets.  Often
therefore,
organizations may need to explicitly define the acceptable outbound communication policies
for their networks. In most cases the acceptable outbound connections would include SMTP
to any address from only your SMTP mail gateway(s), DNS to any address from an internal
DNS server to resolve external host names, HTTP and HTTPS from an internal proxy server
for users to browse web sites, NTP to specific time server addresses from an internal time
server(s), any ports required by Anti-Virus, spam filtering, web filtering or patch management
software to only the appropriate vendor address(es) to pull down updates and any other rule
where the business case is documented and signed off by appropriate management.

to  allowing  any  outbound

traffic,

Perimeters may contain proxy firewalls or other servers that act as a control point for Web
browsing,  e-mail,  P2P,  and  other  communications.  Those  firewalls  and  servers  frequently
are  used  to  enforce  the  institution’s  security  policy  over  incoming  communications.
Enforcement  is  through  anti-virus,  anti-spyware,  and  anti-spam  filtering,  the  blocking  of
downloading of executable files, and other actions. To the extent that filtering is done on a
signature basis, frequent updating of the signatures may be required, as had been explained
earlier.

Perimeter  servers  also  serve  to  inspect  outbound  communications  for  compliance  with  the
institution’s  security  policy.  Perimeter  routers  and  firewalls  can  be  configured  to  enforce
policies  that  forbid  the  origination  of  outbound  communications  from  certain  computers.
Additionally, proxy servers could be configured to identify and block customer data and other
data that should not be transmitted outside the security domain.

b)  Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS)

The goal of an IDS is to identify network traffic in near real time. Most IDSs use signatures to
detect  port  scans,  malware,  and  other  abnormal  network  communications.  The  ideal
placement  of  an  IDS  is  external  to  the  organization  as  well  as  internally,  just  behind  the
firewall. This would enable a bank to view the traffic approaching the organization as well as
the traffic that successfully passed through the firewall. Conversely, there will be visibility on
internal  traffic  trying  to  communicate  externally  to  the  network  –  particularly  useful  for
situations where malicious activity originates from inside the firewall.

To use a network IDS (NIDS) effectively, an institution should have a sound understanding
of the detection capability and the effect of placement, tuning, and other network defences
on the detection capability.

P a g e  | 42

The  signature-based  detection  methodology  reads  network  packets  and  compares  the
content of the packets against signatures, or unique characteristics, of known attacks. When
a match is recognized between current readings and a signature, the IDS generates an alert.
A  weakness  in  the  signature-based  detection  method  is  that  a  signature  must  exist  for  an
alert to be generated. Signatures are written to either capture known exploits, or to alert to
suspected vulnerabilities. Vulnerability-based detection is generally broad based, alerting on
many exploits for the same vulnerability and potentially alerting on exploits that are not yet
known which is not the case with exploit-based signatures which may be based on specific
exploits only and may not alert when a new or previously unknown exploit is attempted.

This  problem  can  be  particularly  acute  if  the  institution  does  not  continually  update  its
signatures  to  reflect  lessons  learned  from  attacks  on  itself  and  others,  as  well  as
developments  in  attack  tool  technologies.  It  can  also  pose  problems  when  the  signatures
only address known attacks. Another weakness is in the capacity of the NIDS to read traffic.
If  the  NIDS  falls  behind  in  reading  network  packets,  traffic  may  be  allowed  to  bypass  the
NIDS.  Such  traffic  may  contain  attacks  that  would  otherwise  cause  the  NIDS  to  issue  an
alert.

The  anomaly-based  detection  method  generally  detects  deviations  from  a  baseline.  The
baseline  can  be  either  protocol-based,  or  behaviour-based.  The  protocol-based  baseline
detects  differences  between  the  detected  packets  for  a  given  protocol  and  the  Internet’s
RFCs (Requests for Comment) pertaining to that protocol. For example, a header field could
exceed the RFC-established expected size.

The behaviour-based anomaly detection method creates a statistical profile of normal activity
on the host or network. Normal activity generally is measured based on the volume of traffic,
protocols in use, and connection patterns between various devices. Benchmarks for activity
are  established  based  on  that  profile.  When  current  activity  exceeds  the  identified
boundaries,  an  alert  is  generated.  Weaknesses  in  this  system  involve  the  ability  of  the
system to accurately model activity, the relationship between valid activity in the period being
modelled  and  valid  activity  in  future  periods,  and  the  potential  for  malicious  activity  to  take
place while the modelling is performed. This method is best employed in environments with
predictable, stable activity.

Anomaly detection can be an effective supplement to signature-based methods by signalling
attacks  for which  no  signature  yet  exists.  Proper  placement  of  NIDS  sensors  is  a  strategic
decision  determined  by  the  information  the  bank  is  trying  to  obtain.  Placement  outside  the
firewall  will  deliver  IDS  alarms  related  to  all  attacks,  even  those  that  are  blocked  by  the
firewall.  With  this  information,  an  institution  can  develop  a  picture  of  potential  adversaries
and their expertise based on the probes they issue against the network.

Because  the  placement  is  meant  to  gain  intelligence  on  attackers  rather  than  to  alert  on
attacks, tuning generally makes the NIDS less sensitive than if it is placed inside the firewall.
A  NIDS  outside  the  firewall  will  generally  alert  on  the  greatest  number  of  unsuccessful
attacks  while  NIDS  monitoring  behind  the  firewall  is  meant  to  detect  and  alert  on  hostile
intrusions.  Multiple  NIDS  units  can  be  used,  with  placement  determined  by  the  expected
attack paths to sensitive data. In general, the closer the NIDS is to sensitive data, the more
important the tuning, monitoring, and response to NIDS alerts. It is generally recommended
that  NIDS  can  be  placed  at  any  location  where  network  traffic  from  external  entities  is
allowed to enter controlled or private networks.

“Tuning”  refers  to  the  creation  of  signatures  and  alert  filters  that  can  distinguish  between
normal  network  traffic  and  potentially  malicious  traffic  apart  from  involving  creation  and
implementation  of  different  alerting  and  logging  actions  based  on  the  severity  of  the
perceived  attack.  Proper  tuning  is  essential  to  both  reliable  detection  of  attacks  and  the

P a g e  | 43

enabling  of  a  priority-based  response.  If  IDS  is  not  properly  tuned,  the  volume  of  alerts  it
generates may degrade the intrusion identification and response capability.

Switched  networks  pose  a  problem  for  a  network  IDS  since  the  switches  ordinarily  do  not
broadcast  traffic  to  all  ports  while  NIDS  may  need  to  see  all  traffic  to  be  effective.  When
switches do not have a port that receives all traffic, a bank may have to alter its network to
include a hub or other device to allow the IDS to monitor traffic. Encryption poses a potential
limitation  for  a  NIDS.  If  traffic  is  encrypted,  the  NIDS’s  effectiveness  may  be  limited  to
anomaly  detection  based  on  unencrypted  header  information.  This  limitation  can  by
overcome  by  decrypting  packets  within  the  IDS  at  rates  commensurate  with  the  flow  of
traffic.  Decryption  is  a  device-specific  feature  that  may  not  be  incorporated  into  all  NIDS
units.

All NIDS detection methods result in false positives (alerts where no attack exists) and false
negatives (no alert when an attack does take place). While false negatives are obviously a
concern,
false  positives  can  also  hinder  detection.  When  security  personnel  are
overwhelmed  with  the  number  of  false  positives,  their  review  of  NIDS  reports  may  be  less
effective  thereby  allowing  real  attacks  to  be  reported  by  the  NIDS  but  not  suitably  acted
upon. Additionally, they  may tune the NIDS to reduce the number of false positives, which
may increase the number of false negatives. Risk-based testing is necessary in this regard
to ensure the detection capability is adequate.

c)  Network Intrusion Prevention Systems

Network  Intrusion  Prevention  Systems  (NIPS)  are  an  access  control mechanism  that  allow
or disallow access based on an analysis of packet headers and packet payloads. They are
similar to firewalls because they are located in the communications line, compare activity to
pre-configured  decisions  of  the  type  of  packets  to  filter  or  block,  and  respond  with  pre-
configured actions. The IPS units generally detect security events in a manner similar to IDS
units and are subject to the same limitations. After detection, however, the IPS unit have the
capability to take actions beyond simple alerting to potential malicious activity and logging of
packets  such  as  blocking  traffic  flows  from  an  offending  host.  The  ability  to  sever
communications can be useful when the activity can clearly be identified as malicious. When
the  activity  cannot  be  clearly  identified,  for  example  where  a  false  positive  may  exist,  IDS-
like  alerting  commonly  is  preferable  to  blocking.  Although  IPS  units  are  access  control
devices,  many  of  these  units  implement  a  security  model  that  is  different  from  firewalls.
Firewalls  typically  allow  only  the  traffic  necessary  for  business  purposes,  or  only  “known
good” traffic. IPS units typically are configured to disallow traffic that triggers signatures, or
“known  bad”  traffic,  while  allowing  all  else.  However,  IPS  units  can  be  configured  to  more
closely mimic a device that allows only “known good” traffic. IPS units also contain a “white
list”  of  IP  addresses  that  should  never  be  blocked.  The  list  helps  ensure  that  an  attacker
cannot achieve a denial of service by spoofing the IP of a critical host.

d)  Quarantine

Quarantining  a  device  protects  the  network  from  potentially  malicious  code  or  actions.
Typically,  a  device  connecting  to  a  security  domain  is  queried  for  conformance  to  the
domain’s security policy. If the device does not conform, it is placed in a restricted part of the
network until it does conform. For example, if the patch level is not current, the device is not
allowed into the security domain until the appropriate patches are downloaded and installed.

e)  DNS Placement

Effective  protection  of  the  institution’s  DNS  servers  is  critical  to  maintaining  the  security  of
the  institution’s  communications.  Much  of  the  protection  is  provided  by  host  security
However,  the  placement  of  the  DNS  also  is  an  important  factor.  The  optimal  placement  is
split DNS, where one firewalled DNS server serves public domain information to the outside

P a g e  | 44

and  does  not  perform  recursive  queries,  and  a  second  DNS  server,  in  an  internal  security
domain and not the DMZ, performs recursive queries for internal users.

viii. Improving the security of networks

In  addition  to  the  above,  the  following  are  among  the  factors  that  need  to  be  followed  for
improving the security of networks:

a.  Inventory of authorized and unauthorized devices and software.
b.  Secure  Configurations/hardening  for  all  hardware  and  software  on
Laptops,  Workstations,  and  Servers  and  Network  Devices  such  as
Firewalls,  Routers  and Switches.  Configuration  management  begins  with
well-tested and documented security baselines for various systems. There
need  to  be  documented  security  baselines  for  all  types  of  information
systems.
Identifying all connections to critical networks and conducting risk analysis
including  necessity  for  each  connection.  All  unnecessary  connections  to
critical networks to be disconnected.

c.

d.  Implementation  of  the  security  features  recommended  by  device  and

system vendors.

e.  Establishing strong controls over any medium that is used as a backdoor
into  the  critical  network.  If  backdoors  or  vendor  connections  do  exist  in
critical  systems,  strong  authentication  must  be  implemented  to  ensure
secure communications.
Implementation  of  internal  and  external  intrusion  detection  system,
incident response system and establishing 24x7 incident monitoring

f.

g.  Performing  technical  audits  including  vulnerability  assessment  of  critical
devices  and  networks,  and  any  other  connected  networks,  to  identify
security concerns

h.  Conducting  physical  security  surveys  and  assessing  all  remote  sites
connected  to  the  critical  network  to  evaluate  their  security.  Any  location
that  has  a  connection  to  the  critical  network  is  a  target,  especially
unmanned  or  unguarded  remote  sites.    There  is  also  a  need  to  identify
and  assess  any  source  of  information  including  remote  telephone  /
computer  network  /  fiber  optic  cables  that  could  be  tapped;  radio  and
microwave  links  that  are  exploitable;  computer  terminals  that  could  be
accessed;  and  wireless  local  area  network  access  points.    Identify  and
eliminate single points of failure.

i.  Establishing critical "Red Teams" to identify and evaluate possible attack
scenarios.  There  is  a  need  to  feed  information  resulting  from  the  "Red
Team"  evaluation  into  risk  management  processes  to  assess  the
information and establish appropriate protection strategies.

j.  Documenting  network  architecture  and  identifying  systems  that  serve
critical  functions  or  contain  sensitive  information  that  require  additional
levels of protection.

k.  Establishing a rigorous, ongoing risk management process.
l.  Establishing a network protection strategy and layered security based on
the principle of defense-in-depth is an absolute necessity for banks. This
would  require  suitable  measures  to  address  vulnerabilities  across  the
hardware,  operating  system,  middleware,  database,  network  and
application  layers.  Security  is  not  an  event  but  a  process  which  requires
all  its  various  components  to  be  functioning  well  together  for  their
effectiveness.  Additionally,  each  layer  must  be  protected  against  other
systems at the same layer.  For example, to protect against insider threat,
restrict  users  to  access  only  those  resources  necessary  to  perform  their
job functions.

P a g e  | 45

m.  Establishing  system  backups  and  disaster  recovery  plans.  Establish  a
disaster recovery plan that allows for rapid recovery from any emergency
(including a cyber attack).

n.  Establishing  policies  and  conducting  training  to  minimize  the  likelihood
that  organizational  personnel  would  inadvertently  disclose  sensitive
information  regarding  critical  system  design,  operations,  or  security
controls through social engineering attempts. Any requests for information
by unknown persons need to be sent to a central network security location
for verification and fulfillment.  People can be a weak link in an otherwise
secure network, as had been indicated earlier in the chapter.

o.  Network control functions should be performed by individuals possessing
adequate  training  and  experience.  Network  control  functions  should  be
separated,  and  the  duties  should  be  rotated  on  a  regular  basis,  where
possible.  Network  control  software  must  restrict  operator  access  from
performing  certain  functions  (e.g.,  the  ability  to  amend/delete  operator
activity logs).

p.  Network  control  software  should  maintain  an  audit  trail  of  all  operator
activities.  Audit  trails  should  be  periodically  reviewed  by  operations
management to detect any unauthorized network operations activities.
q.  Network  operation  standards  and  protocols  should  be  documented  and
made  available  to  the  operators,  and  should  be  reviewed  periodically  to
ensure compliance.

r.  Network access by system engineers should be monitored and reviewed

closely to detect unauthorized access to the network.

s.  Another  important  security  improvement  is  the  ability  to  identify  users  at
every  step  of  their  activity.  Some  application  packages  use  predefined
user  id.  New  monitoring  tools  have  been  developed  to  resolve  this
problem.

25) Remote Access:

i.  Banks  may  sometimes  provide  employees,  vendors,  and  others  with  access  to  the
institution’s  network  and  computing  resources  through  external  connections.  Those
connections  are  typically  established  through  modems,  the  internet,  or  private
communications  lines.  The  access  may  be  necessary  to  remotely  support  the
institution’s  systems  or  to  support  institution  operations  at  remote  locations.  In  some
cases,  remote  access  may  be  required  periodically  by  vendors  to  make  emergency
programme fixes or to support a system.

ii.  Remote access to a bank’s provides an attacker with the opportunity to manipulate and
subvert  the  bank’s  systems  from  outside  the  physical  security  perimeter.  The
management  should  establish  policies  restricting  remote  access  and  be  aware  of  all
remote-access  devices  attached  to  their  systems.  These  devices  should  be  strictly
controlled.

iii.  Good controls for remote access include the following actions:

a.  Disallowing  remote  access  by  policy  and  practice  unless  a  compelling  business

need exists and requiring management approval for remote access

b.  Regularly reviewing remote access approvals and rescind those that no longer have

a compelling business justification

c.  Appropriately configuring and securing remote access devices
d.  Appropriately  and  in  a  timely  manner  patching,  updating  and  maintaining  all

software on remote access devices

e.  Using  encryption  to  protect  communications  between  the  access  device  and  the

institution and to protect sensitive data residing on the access device
f.  Periodically auditing the access device configurations and patch levels

P a g e  | 46

g.  Using  VLANs,  network  segments,  directories,  and  other  techniques  to  restrict
remote access to authorized network areas and applications within the institution
h.  Logging  remote  access  communications,  analyzing  them  in  a  timely  manner,  and

following up on anomalies

i.  Centralize  modem  and  Internet  access  to  provide  a  consistent  authentication
process,  and  to  subject  the  inbound  and  outbound  network  traffic  to  appropriate
perimeter protections and network monitoring

j.  Logging  and  monitoring  the  date,  time,  user,  user  location,  duration,  and  purpose

for all remote access including all activities carried out through remote access

k.  Requiring  a  two-factor  authentication  process  for  remote  access  (e.g.,  PIN  based

l.

token card with a one-time random password generator, or token based PKI)
Implementing  controls  consistent  with  the  sensitivity  of  remote  use.  For  example,
remote use to administer sensitive systems or databases may include the controls
like  restricting  the  use  of  the  access  device  by  policy  and  configuration,  requiring
authentication of the access device itself and ascertaining the trustworthiness of the
access device before granting access

iv.  If remote access is through modems the following steps should be taken:

a.  Require  an  operator  to  leave  the  modems  unplugged  or  disabled  by  default,  to
enable  modems  only  for  specific  and  authorized  external  requests,  and  disable  the
modem immediately when the requested purpose is completed

b.  Configure modems not to answer inbound calls, if modems are for outbound use only
c.  Use automated callback features so the modems only call one number although this

is subject to call forwarding schemes

d.  Install  a  modem  bank  where  the  outside  number  to  the  modems  uses  a  different

prefix than internal numbers and does not respond to incoming calls

v.  While  using  TCP/IP  Internet-based  remote  access,  organizations  need  to  establish  a
virtual private network over the Internet to securely communicate data packets over this
public  infrastructure.  Available  VPN  technologies  apply  the  Internet  Engineering  Task
Force  (IETF)  IPSec  security  standard  advantages  are  their  ubiquity,  ease  of  use,
inexpensive connectivity, and read, inquiry or copy only access. Disadvantages include
the  fact  that  they  are  significantly  less  reliable  than  dedicated  circuits,  lack  a  central
authority, and can have troubleshooting problems.

vi.  Banks need to be aware that using VPNs to allow remote access to their systems can
create holes in their security infrastructure. The encrypted traffic can hide unauthorized
actions or malicious software that can be transmitted through such channels. Intrusion
detection  systems  and  virus  scanners  able  to  decrypt  the  traffic  for  analysis  and  then
encrypt  and  forward  it  to  the  VPN  endpoint  should  be  considered  as  preventive
controls.  A good  practice  will  terminate  all  VPNs  to  the  same  end-point  in  a  so called
VPN concentrator, and will not accept VPNs directed at other parts of the network.

26) Distributed Denial of service attacks(DDoS/DoS):

a.  Banks  providing  internet  banking  should  be  responsive  to  unusual  network
traffic  conditions/system  performance  and  sudden  surge  in  system  resource
utilization which could be an indication of a DDoS attack. Consequently, the
success of any pre-emptive and reactive actions depends on the deployment
of  appropriate  tools  to  effectively  detect,  monitor  and  analyze  anomalies  in
networks and systems.

b.  As  part  of  the  defence  strategy,  banks  should  install  and  configure  network
reasonable
security  devices  discussed  earlier
preventive/detective  capability.  Potential  bottlenecks  and  single  points  of
failure  vulnerable  to  DDoS  attacks  could  be  identified  through  source  code

the  chapter

for

in

P a g e  | 47

review,  network  design  analysis  and  configuration  testing.  Addressing  these
vulnerabilities would improve resilience of the systems.

c.  Banks can also consider incorporating DoS attack considerations in their ISP
selection  process.  An  incident  response  framework  should  be  devised  and
validated  periodically  to  facilitate  fast  response  to  a  DDoS  onslaught  or  an
imminent  attack.  Banks  may  also  need  to  be  familiar  with  the  ISPs’  incident
response plans and suitably consider them as part of their incident response
framework.  To
foster  better  coordination,  banks  should  establish  a
communication  protocol  with  their  ISPs  and  conduct  periodic  joint  incident
response exercises.

27) Implementation of ISO 27001 Information Security Management System

(a)  Commercial  banks  should  implement  Information  Security  Management  System

(ISMS) best practices for their critical functions/processes.

(b)  The best known ISMS is described in ISO/IEC 27001 and ISO/IEC 27002 and related
standards  published  jointly  by  ISO  and  IEC.  ISO  27001  is  concerned  with  how  to
implement,  monitor,  maintain  and  continually  improve  an  Information  Security
Management  System  while  ISO  27002  provides  detailed  steps  or  a  list  of  security
measures  which  can  be  used  when  building  an  ISMS.  Other  frameworks  such  as
COBIT  and  ITIL  though  incorporate  security  aspects,  but  are  mainly  geared  toward
creating a governance framework for information and IT more generally. As with all
management  processes,  an  ISMS  must  remain  effective  and  efficient  in  the  long
term,  adapting  to  changes  in  the  internal  organization  and  external  environment.
ISO/IEC  27001,  thus,  incorporates  the  typical  "Plan-Do-Check-Act"  (PDCA),  or
Deming cycle, approach:
(cid:131)  The Plan phase is about designing the ISMS, assessing information security risks

and selecting appropriate controls.

(cid:131)  The Do phase involves implementing and operating the controls.
(cid:131)  The Check phase objective is to review and evaluate the performance (efficiency

(cid:131)

and effectiveness) of the ISMS.
In the Act phase, changes are made where necessary to bring the ISMS back to
peak performance.

(c)  An ISMS developed and based on risk acceptance/rejection criteria, and using third
party  accredited  certification  to  provide  an  independent  verification  of  the  level  of
assurance, is an extremely useful management tool. It offers the opportunity to define
and monitor service levels internally as well as with contractor/partner organizations,
thus demonstrating the extent to which there is effective control of security risks.
(d)  Further,  a  bank  should  also  regularly  assess  the  comprehensiveness  of  its
information  security  risk  management  framework  by  comparison  to peers  and  other
established  control  frameworks  and  standards  including  any  security  related
frameworks issued by reputed institutions like IDRBT or DSCI.

(e)  While  implementing  ISO  27001  and  aspects  from  other  relevant  standards,  banks
should  be  wary  of  a  routine  checklist  kind  of  mindset  but  ensure  that  the  security
management is dynamic in nature through proactively scanning the environment for
new threats and suitably attuned to the changing milieu.

28) Wireless Security

i.  Wireless  networks  security  is  a  challenge  since  they  do  not  have  a  well-defined
perimeter  or  well-defined  access  points.    It  includes  all  wireless  data  communication
devices  like  personal  computers,  cellular  phones,  PDAs,  etc.  connected  to  a  bank’s
internal networks.

P a g e  | 48

ii.  Unlike  wired  networks,  unauthorized  monitoring  and  denial  of  service  attacks  can  be
performed  without  a  physical  wire  connection.  Additionally,  unauthorized  devices  can
potentially  connect  to  the  network,  perform  man-in-the-  middle  attacks,  or  connect  to
other wireless devices. To mitigate those risks, wireless networks rely on extensive use
of encryption to authenticate users and devices and to shield communications. If a bank
uses a wireless network, it should carefully evaluate the risk and implement appropriate
additional  controls.  Examples  of  additional  controls  may  include  one  or  more  of  the
following:

•  Treating  wireless  networks  as  untrusted  networks,  allowing  access  through
protective  devices  similar  to  those  used  to  shield  the  internal  network  from  the
Internet environment

•  Using end-to-end encryption in addition to the encryption provided by the wireless

connection

•  Using  strong  authentication  and  configuration  controls  at  the  access  points  and

on all clients

•  Using an application server and dumb terminals
•  Shielding  the  area  in  which  the  wireless  LAN  operates  to  protect  against  stray

emissions and signal interference

•  Monitoring and responding to unauthorized wireless access points and clients

iii.  All wireless Access Points / Base Stations connected to the corporate network must be
registered  and  approved  by  Information  Security  function  of  a  bank.  These  Access
Points  /  Base  Stations  need  to  subjected  to  periodic  penetration  tests  and  audits.
Updated inventory on all wireless Network Interface Cards used in corporate laptop or
desktop  computers  must  be  available.  Access  points/Wireless  NIC  should  not  be
installed  /enabled  on  a  bank’s  network  without  the  approval  of  information  security
function.

iv.  Banks should ensure that each wireless device connected to the network matches an
authorized  configuration  and  security  profile,  with  a  documented  owner  of  the
connection  and  a  defined  business  need.  Organizations  should  deny  access  to  those
wireless devices that do not have such a configuration and profile.

v.  Banks  should  ensure  that  all  wireless  access  points  are  manageable  using  enterprise

management tools.

vi.  Network  vulnerability  scanning  tools  should  be  configured  to  detect  wireless  access
points connected to the wired network. Identified devices should be reconciled against
a  list  of  authorized  wireless  access  points.  Unauthorized  (i.e.,  rogue)  access  points
should be deactivated.

vii.  Banks  should  use  wireless  intrusion  detection  systems  (WIDS)  to  identify  rogue
wireless devices and detect attack attempts and successful compromise.  In addition to
WIDS, all wireless traffic should be monitored by a wired IDS as traffic passes into the
wired network.

viii. Where a specific business need for wireless access has been identified, banks should
configure  wireless  access  on  client  machines  to  allow  access  only  to  authorized
wireless networks.

ix.  For  devices  that  do  not  have  an  essential  wireless  business  purpose,  organizations
should  consider  disable  wireless  access  in  the  hardware  configuration  (BIOS  or  EFI),
with  password  protections  to  lower  the  possibility  that  the  user  will  override  such
configurations.

x.  Banks  should  regularly  scan  for  unauthorized  or  misconfigured  wireless  infrastructure
devices,  using  techniques  such  as  “war  driving”  to  identify  access  points  and  clients
accepting  peer-to-peer  connections.  Such  unauthorized  or  misconfigured  devices
should be removed from the network, or have their configurations altered so that they
comply with the security requirements of the organization.

P a g e  | 49

xi.  Banks should ensure all wireless traffic leverages at least AES encryption used with at
least  WPA2  protection.  Banks  should  ensure  wireless  networks  use  authentication
protocols  such  as  EAP/TLS  or  PEAP,  which  provide  credential  protection  and  mutual
authentication.

xii.  Banks should ensure wireless clients use strong, multi-factor authentication credentials

to mitigate the risk of unauthorized access from compromised credentials.

xiii. Banks  should  disable  peer-to-peer  wireless  network  capabilities  on  wireless  clients,

unless such functionality meets a documented business need.

xiv. Banks should disable wireless peripheral access of devices (such as Bluetooth), unless

such access is required for a documented business need.

xv. Banks  may  consider  configuring  all  wireless  clients  used  to  access  other  critical
networks  or  handle  organization  data  in  a  manner  so  that  they  cannot  be  used  to
connect  to  public  wireless  networks  or  any  other  networks  beyond  those  specifically
allowed by the bank.

xvi. Some requirements relating to VPN that may be considered :

•  Access should be provided only if there’s a genuine business case
•  All  computers  with  wireless  LAN  devices  must  utilize  a  Virtual  Private  Network

(VPN) that configured to drop all unauthenticated and unencrypted traffic

•  Wireless implementations must maintain point-to-point hardware encryption of at

least 128 bits

•  Supporting  a  hardware  address,  like  MAC  address,  that  can  be  registered  and
tracked  and  supporting  strong  user  authentication  which  checks  against  an
external database such as TACACS+, RADIUS etc
Implementation  of  mutual  authentication  of  user  and  authentication  server  and
survey needs to be done before location of access points to ensure that signals
are confined within the premise as much as possible

•

•  Communication between the workstations and access points should be encrypted

using dynamic session keys

29) Business Continuity Considerations:

Events  that  trigger  the  implementation  of  a  business  continuity  plan  may  have  significant
security  implications.  Depending  on  the  event,  some  or  all  of  the  elements  of  the  security
environment  may  change.  Different  tradeoffs  may  exist  between  availability,  integrity,
confidentiality,  and  accountability,  with  a  different  appetite  for  risk  on  the  part  of
management.  Business  continuity  plans  should  be  reviewed  as  an  integral  part  of  the
security process.

Risk  assessments  should  consider  the  changing  risks  that  appear  in  business  continuity
scenarios  and  the  different  security  posture  that  may  be  established.  Strategies  should
consider the different risk environment and the degree of risk mitigation necessary to protect
the  institution  in  the  event  the  continuity  plans  must  be  implemented.  The  implementation
should  consider  the  training  of  appropriate  personnel  in  their  security  roles,  and  the
implementation  and  updating  of
for  back-up  sites  and
communications  networks.  These  security  considerations  should  be  integrated  with  the
testing  of  business  continuity  plan  implementations.  More  information  on  “Business
Continuity Planning” is provided in a separate chapter.

30) Information security assurance

a) Penetration Testing:
Penetration  testing  is  defined  as  a  formalized  set  of  procedures  designed  to  bypass  the
security  controls  of  a  system  or  organization  for  the  purpose  of  testing  that  system’s  or
organization’s resistance to such an attack.

Penetration  testing  is  performed  to  uncover  the  security  weaknesses  of  a  system  and  to
determine  the  ways  in  which  the  system  can  be  compromised  by  a  potential  attacker.
Penetration  testing  can  take  several  forms  but,  in  general,  a  test  consists  of  a  series  of
“attacks” against a target. The success or failure of the attacks, and how the target reacts to
each attack, will determine the outcome of the test.

The overall purpose of a penetration test is to determine the subject’s ability to withstand an
attack by a hostile intruder. As such, the tester will be using the tricks and techniques a real-
life  attacker  might  use.  This  simulated  attack  strategy  allows  the  subject  to  discover  and
mitigate  its  security  weak  spots  before  a  real  attacker  discovers  them.    Because  a
penetration  test  seldom  is  a  comprehensive  test  of  the  system’s  security,  it  should  be
combined with other monitoring to validate the effectiveness of the security process.

Penetration testing needs to be conducted at least on an annual basis.

b) Audits
Auditing  compares  current  practices  against  a  set  of  policies/standards/guidelines
formulated by the institution, regulator including any legal requirements. Bank management
is  responsible  for  demonstrating  that  the  standards  it  adopts  are  appropriate  for  the
institution. Audits should not only look into technical aspects but also the information security
governance process.

c) Assessment
An assessment is a study to locate security vulnerabilities and identify corrective actions. An
assessment differs from an audit by not having a set of standards to test against. It differs
from a penetration test by providing the tester with full access to the systems being tested.
Assessments may be focused on the security process or the information system. They may
also  focus  on  different  aspects  of  the  information  system,  such  as  one  or  more  hosts  or
networks. Vulnerability assessment was explained earlier in the chapter.

The  assurance  work  needs  to  be  performed  by  appropriately  trained  and  independent
information  security  experts/auditors.  The  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  critical  internet-
based applications, other critical systems and networks needs to be carried out before each
initial  implementation,  and  at  least  annually  thereafter.  Any  findings  needs  to  be  reported
and monitored using a systematic audit remediation or compliance tracking methodology.

A  bank  needs  to  regularly  assess  information  security  vulnerabilities  and  evaluate  the
effectiveness of the existing IT security risk management framework, making any necessary
adjustments  to  ensure  emerging  vulnerabilities  are  addressed  in  a  timely  manner.  This
assessment should also be conducted as part of any material change.

Robust  performance  evaluation  processes  are  needed  to  provide  organizations  with
feedback on the effectiveness of cyber security policy and technical implementation.  A sign
of  a  mature  organization  is  one  that  is  able  to  self-identify  issues,  conduct  root  cause
analyses,  and  implement  effective  corrective  actions  that  address  individual  and  systemic
problems.  Self-assessment  processes  that  are  normally  part  of  an  effective  cyber  security
program include routine scanning for vulnerabilities, automated auditing of the network, and -
assessments of organizational and individual business line security related performance.

A bank should manage the information security risk management framework on an ongoing
basis  as  a  security  programme  following  project  management  approach,  addressing  the
control gaps in a systematic way.

31) General information regarding delivery channels

(i)  Provision  of  various  electronic  banking  channels  like  ATM/debit  cards/internet
banking/phone banking should be issued only at the option of the customers based
on  specific  written  or  authenticated  electronic  requisition  along  with  a  positive
acknowledgement  of  the  terms  and  conditions  from  the  customer.  A  customer
should not be forced to opt for services in this regard.  Banks should provide clear
information  to  their  customers  about  the  risks  and  benefits  of  using  e-banking
delivery services to enable customers to decide on choosing such services.

(ii)  When  new  operating  features  or  functions,  particularly  those  relating  to  security,
integrity  and  authentication,  are  being  introduced,  the  bank  should  ensure  that
customers have sufficient instruction and information to be able to properly utilize
them.

(iii) To  raise  security  awareness,  banks  should  sensitize  customers  on  the  need  to
protect their PINs, security tokens, personal details and other confidential data.

(iv) Banks  are  responsible  for  the  safety  and  soundness  of  the  services  and  systems
they  provide  to  their  customers.  Reciprocally,  it  is  also  important  that  customers
take appropriate security measures to protect their devices and computer systems
and  ensure  that  their  integrity  is  not  compromised  when  engaging  in  online
banking.  Customers  should  implement  the  measures  advised  by  their  banks
regarding  protecting  their  devices  or  computers  which  they  use  for  accessing
banking services.

(v) In  view  of  the  constant  changes  occurring  in  the  internet  environment  and  online
delivery  channels,  management  should  institute a  risk  monitoring  and  compliance
regime on an ongoing basis to ascertain the performance and effectiveness of the
risk management process. When risk parameters change, the risk process needs
to  be  updated  and  enhanced  accordingly.  Re-evaluation  of  past  risk-control
measures  and  equations,  renewed  testing  and  auditing  of  the  adequacy  and
effectiveness  of  the  risk  management  process  and  the  attendant  controls  and
security measures taken should be conducted.

 (g) Internet banking:

i.  Banks  need  to  ensure  suitable  security  measures  for  their  web  applications  and  take
reasonable  mitigating  measures  against  various  web  security  risks  indicated  earlier  in  the
chapter.
ii.Web applications should not store sensitive information in HTML hidden fields, cookies, or
any other client-side storage leading to compromise in the integrity of the data. Critical web
applications should enforce at least SSL v3 or Extended Validation –SSL / TLS 1.0 128 bit
encryption level for all online activity.
iii.Re-establishment  of  any  session  after

interruption  should  require  normal  user

P a g e  | 52

identification,  authentication,  and  authorization.  Moreover,  strong  server  side  validation
should be enabled.
iv. Banks need to follow a defense in depth strategy by applying robust security measures
across various technology layers

Authentication practices for internet banking:

1) Authentication methodologies involve three basic “factors”:

-  Something the user knows (e.g., password, PIN);
-  Something the user has (e.g., ATM card, smart card); and
-  Something the user is (e.g., biometric characteristic, such as a fingerprint).

2) Properly designed and implemented multifactor authentication methods are more reliable
and stronger fraud deterrents and are more difficult to compromise. The principal objectives
of  two-factor  authentication  are  to  protect  the  confidentiality  of  customer  account  data  and
transaction details as well as enhance confidence in internet banking by combating various
cyber  attack  mechanisms  like  phishing,  keylogging,  spyware/malware  and  other  internet-
based frauds targeted at banks and their customers.

Implementation of two-factor authentication and other security measures for internet
banking:

1.  In view of the proliferation of cyber attacks and their potential consequences, banks
should  implement  two-factor  authentication  for  fund  transfers  through  internet
banking.

2.  The implementation of appropriate authentication methodologies should be based on
an  assessment  of  the  risk  posed  by  the  institution’s  Internet  banking  systems.  The
risk  should  be  evaluated  in  light  of  the  type  of  customer  (e.g.,  retail  or
corporate/commercial);  the  customer  transactional  capabilities  (e.g.,  bill  payment,
fund transfer), the sensitivity of customer information being communicated to both the
bank and the volume of transactions involved.

3.  Beyond  the  technology  factor,  the  success  of  a  particular  authentication  method
depends  on  appropriate  policies,  procedures,  and  controls.  An  effective
authentication method should take into consideration customer acceptance, ease of
use,  reliable  performance,  scalability  to  accommodate  growth,  and  interoperability
with other systems.

4.  There is a legal risk in not using the asymmetric cryptosystem and hash function for
authenticating  electronic  transactions.  However,  it  is  observed  that  some  banks  still
use  weak  user  id/password  based  authentication  for  fund  transfers  using  internet
banking.  For  carrying  out  critical  transactions  like  fund  transfers,  the  banks,  at  the
least, need to implement robust and dynamic two-factor authentication through user
id/password  combination  and  second  factor  like  (a)  a  digital  signature  (through  a
token  containing  digital  certificate  and  associated  private  key)  (preferably  for  the
corporate customers) or (b) OTP/dynamic access code through various modes (like
SMS over mobile phones or hardware token).

5.   To  enhance  online  processing

channel
procedures(like  telephony,  SMS,  email  etc)  should  be  applied  in  respect  of
transactions  above  pre-set  values,  creation  of  new  account  linkages,  registration  of
third party payee details, changing account details or revision to funds transfer limits.
In  devising  these  security  features,  the  bank  should  take  into  account  their  efficacy
and differing customer preferences for additional online protection.

6.  Based  on  mutual  authentication  protocols,  customers  could  also  authenticate  the
bank’s  web  site  through  security  mechanisms  such  as  personal  assurance
messages/images, exchange of challenge response security codes and/or the secure
sockets  layer  (SSL)  server  certificate  verification.  In  recent  times,  Extended
Validation Secure Sockets Layer (EV-SSL) Certificates are increasingly being used.
These  are  special  SSL  Certificates  that  work  with  high  security  Web  browsers  to

P a g e  | 53

clearly identify a Web site's organizational identity.  It should, however, be noted that
SSL is only designed to encrypt data in transit at the network transport layer. It does
not provide end-to-end encryption security at the application layer.

7.  An authenticated session, together with its encryption protocol, should remain intact
throughout  the  interaction  with  the  customer.  Else,  in  the  event  of  interference,  the
session should be terminated and the affected transactions resolved or reversed out.
The customer should be promptly notified of such an incident as the session is being
concluded or subsequently by email, telephone or through other means.

8.  Changes in mobile phone number may be done through request from a branch only
9.  Implementation of virtual keyboard
10. A  cooling  period  for  beneficiary  addition  and  SMS  and  E-mail  alerts  when  new

beneficiaries are added

11. Customers  should  be  advised  to  adopt  various  good  security  precautions  and
practices  in  protecting  their  personal  computer  and  to  avoid  conducting  financial
transactions from public or internet café computers.

12. Risk based transaction monitoring or surveillance process needs to be considered as

an adjunct.

13. An online session would need to be automatically terminated after a fixed period of
time  unless  the  customer  is  re-authenticated  for  the  existing  session  to  be
maintained. This prevents an attacker from keeping an internet banking session alive
indefinitely.

14. By definition true multifactor authentication requires the use of solutions from two or
more  of  the  three  categories  of  factors.  Using  multiple  solutions  from  the  same
category at different points in the process may be part of a layered security or other
compensating  control  approach,  but  it  would  not  constitute  a  true  multifactor
authentication.

15. As  an  integral  part  of  the  two  factor  authentication  architecture,  banks  should  also
implement appropriate measures to minimise exposure to a middleman attack which
is  more  commonly  known  as  a  man-in-the-middle  attack  (MITM),  man-in-the
browser(MITB)  attack  or  man-in-the  application  attack.  The  banks  should  also
consider,  and  if  deemed  appropriate,  implement  the  following  control  and  security
measures to minimise exposure to man-in-the middle attacks:

a.

b.

c.

d.

Specific OTPs for adding new payees: Each new payee should be

authorized by the customer based on an OTP from a second channel which also
shows payee details or the customer’s handwritten signature from a manual
procedure which is verified by the bank.

Individual OTPs for value transactions (payments and fund transfers)
:Each value transaction or an approved list of value transactions above a certain
rupee threshold determined by the customer should require a new OTP.

OTP time window: Challenge-based and time-based OTPs provide strong
security  because  their  period  of  validity  is  controlled  entirely  by  the  bank  and  does
not  depend  user  behaviour.  It  is  recommended  that  the  banks  should  not  allow  the
OTP time window to exceed 100 seconds on either side of the server time since the
smaller the time window, the lower the risk of OTP misuse.

Payment  and  fund  transfer  security:  Digital  signatures  and  key-based
message  authentication  codes  (KMAC)  for  payment  or  fund  transfer  transactions
could  be  considered  for  the  detection  of  unauthorized  modification  or  injection  of
transaction data in a middleman attack. For this security solution to work effectively,
a customer using a hardware token would need to be able to distinguish the process
of generating a one-time password from the process of digitally signing a transaction.
What  he  signs  digitally  must  also  be  meaningful  to  him,  which  means  the  token
should at least explicitly show the payee account number and the payment amount
from  which  a  hash  value  may  be  derived  for  the  purpose  of  creating  a  digital
signature. Different crypto keys should be used for generating OTPs and for signing
transactions.

P a g e  | 54

e.

f.

g.

Second channel notification / confirmation: The bank should notify the
customer, through a second channel, of all payment or fund transfer transactions
above a specified value determined by the customer.

Session  time-out:  An  online  session  would  be  automatically  terminated
after  a  fixed  period  of  time  unless  the  customer  is  re-authenticated  for  the  existing
session to be maintained. This prevents an attacker from keeping an internet banking
session alive indefinitely.

SSL server certificate warning: Internet banking customers should be

made aware of and shown how to react to SSL or EV-SSL certificate warning.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES AND INFORMATION SECURITY:

increasingly  being
Discussed  below  are  some  emerging
adopted/likely to be considered in the near future. However, the security concerns in respect
of such technologies need to be considered.

technologies  which  are

1. Virtualization

Background:
Over the last 10 years, the trend in the data center has been towards decentralization, also
known  as  horizontal  scaling.  Centralized  servers  were  seen  as  too  expensive  to  purchase
and maintain. Due to this expense, applications were moved from a large shared server to
their own physical machine. Decentralization helped with the ongoing maintenance of each
application,  since  patches  and  upgrades  could  be  applied  without  interfering  with  other
running  systems.  For  the  same  reason,  decentralization  improves  security  since  a
compromised system is isolated from other systems on the network.

However,  decentralization’s  application  sandboxes  come  at  the  expense  of  more  power
consumption,  more  physical  space  requirement,  and  a  greater  management  effort  which
increased annual maintenance costs per machine. In addition to this maintenance overhead,
decentralization  decreases  the  efficiency  of  each  machine,  leaving  the  average  server  idle
85%  of  the  time.  Together,  these  inefficiencies  often  eliminate  any  savings  promised  by
decentralization.

Virtualization  is  a  modified  solution  between  centralized  and  decentralized  deployments.
Instead  of  purchasing  and  maintaining  an  entire  computer  for  one  application,  each
application  can  be  given  its  own  operating  system,  and  all  those  operating  systems  can
reside  on  a  single  piece  of  hardware.  This  provides  the  benefits  of  decentralization,  like
security and stability, while making the most of a machine’s resources.

Challenges of Virtualization

a.  Compatibility  and  support  –  Often  software  developers  are  not  ready  to

guarantee fail-safe operation of all their programs in virtual machines.

b.  Licensing  –  There  is  a  need  for  thorough  examination  of  licenses  of  OS,  as
well as other software as far as virtualization is concerned. OS manufacturers
introduce  some  limitations  on  using  their  products  in  virtual  machines
(especially  OEM  versions).  Such  scenarios  are  often  described  in  separate
license  chapters.  There  may  also  be  some  problems  with  licensing  software
based on number of processors, as a virtual machine may emulate different
number of processors than in a host system.

c.  Staff training - This problem is currently one of the most burning ones, as are
difficulty  in  finding  exclusive  virtualization  experts,  who  can  deploy  and
maintain  a  virtual  infrastructure.  "Heavy"  virtualization  platforms  may  require
serious training of staff who will maintain them.

P a g e  | 55

d.  Reliability  -  As  several  virtual  servers  work  on  a  single  physical  server,
failures of hardware components may affect all the virtual servers running on
it. Planning and implementing disaster recovery strategies to ensure reliability
of a virtual infrastructure will be a better solution.

Addressing security issues in virtualization:

There  is  a  misconception  that  if  we  virtualize,  let's  say,  a  Windows  2003  Server,  that
virtualized system should be secure because it is completely separate from the VM Server
operating system and it could be potentially "protected" by VM Server. This is not true and
there are a lot of aspects one needs to know about virtualization security.

The  ultimate  attack  on  a  virtual  host  system  would  be  for  a  guest  system  to  run  malicious
code allowing it to gain elevated privilege and gain access to the underneath VM Server. If
the malicious code could create a new "phantom" virtual machine that could be controlled by
the attacker, they would have full access to the virtual host and all virtual guests. With this
form  of  "hyperjacking",
traditional  virtualization
management  software  and  security  tools.  From  there,  the  attacker  would  perform  a  DoS
(denial of service) attack by overloading the virtual guest systems.

the  attacker  would  be

to

The below covers full virtualization environments that are most commonly used in servers. A
few  major
indicative  measures  are  provided  below.  Additionally,  detailed  vendor
recommended security measures may be followed.
a. Securing the virtualization platform - Privileged partition operating system hardening – (i)
Limit  VM  resource  use:  set  limits  on  the  use  of  resources  (e.g.,  processors,  memory,  disk
space, virtual network interfaces) by each VM so that no one VM can monopolize resources
on a system. (ii) Ensure time synchronization: ensure that host and guests use synchronized
time for investigative and forensic purposes.
b. Unnecessary programmes and services: all unnecessary programs should be uninstalled,
and all unnecessary services should be disabled.
c. Host OS must be patched regularly and in a timely fashion to ensure that the host OS is
protecting  the  system  itself  and  guest  OSs  properly.  In  addition,  the  same  patching
requirements apply to the virtualization software.
d. Partitioning and resource allocation space restrictions: volumes or disk partitioning should
be  used  to  prevent  inadvertent  denials  of  service  from  virtual  machines  (guest  operating
systems, OSs) filling up available space allocations, and allow role-based access controls to
be placed individually on each virtual machine (guest OS).
e.  Disconnect  unused  physical  devices:  individual  VMs  can  be  configured  to  directly  or
indirectly control peripheral devices attached to the host system. VMs should be configured
by default to disable such connections. Connections to peripheral devices should be enabled
only when necessary.
f.  Virtual  devices:  ensure  that  virtual  devices  for  guest  OSs  are  associated  with  the
appropriate  physical  devices  on  the  host  system,  such  as  the  mapping  between  virtual
network interface cards (NICs) to the proper physical NICs.
g.  File  sharing  should  not  be  allowed  between  host  and  guest  OSs:  while  it  might  be
convenient to enable the sharing of system files between the host and guest OSs, allowing
such introduces an unacceptable risk of a guest OS possibly maliciously changing a host OS
file.
h.  Just  as  with  physical  servers,  virtual  systems  need  to  be  regularly  backed-up  for  error
recovery.
i. Carrying out logging and auditing is critical along with correlating server and network logs
across virtual and physical infrastructures to reveal security vulnerabilities and risk
J. Network access for the host OS should be restricted to management services only, and, if
necessary, network access to storage (iSCSI).

P a g e  | 56

k.  A  firewall  should  ideally  be  placed  on  the  host  OS  to  protect  the  system,  or  a  firewall
should at least be local to a small number of systems for protection purposes, with access
allowed  only  for  management  purposes.  Additionally,  the  firewall  should  restrict  access  to
only those systems authorized to manage the virtual infrastructure
l.  Guest  operating  system  hardening  -  Minimize  number  of  accounts-  guests  should  have
accounts necessary for running each VM only with passwords that are strong, hard to guess,
changed frequently, and only provided to staff that must have access. Separate credentials
should  be  used  for  access  to  each  guest  OS;  credentials  should  not  shared  across  guest
OSs, and should not be the same as used for access to the host OS
m.  The  guest  OS  should  be  protected  by  a  firewall  running  on  the  host  OS,  or  at  least
running  locally  (i.e.,  local  to  a  small  number  of  systems  for  protection  purposes).  Firewall
needs  to  discriminate  against  inappropriate  and/or  malicious  traffic  using  networking
communications effective for the environment (e.g., if bridging is used instead of routing).
n.  Consider  using  introspection  capabilities  to  monitor  the  security  of  activity  occurring
between  guest  OSs.  This  is  particularly  important  for  communications  that  in  a  non-
virtualized  environment  were  carried  over  networks  and  monitored  by  network  security
controls (such as network firewalls, security appliances, and network IDS/IPS sensors).

2. Cloud Computing

Background: Computing environment owned by a company is shared with client companies
through web-based service over Internet which hosts all the programs to run everything from
e-mail  to  word  processing  to  complex  data  analysis  programs.  This  is  called  cloud
computing.
The term cloud computing probably comes from the use of a cloud image to represent the
Internet  or  some  large  networked  environment.  We  don’t  care  much  what’s  in  the  cloud  or
what  goes  on  there  except  that  we  get  the  services  we  require.  Service  may  include
software, platform or infrastructure.
At the backend, cloud computing can make use of virtualization and grid computing. In grid
computing,  networked  computers  are  able  to  access  and  use  the  resources  of  every  other
computer on the network.

Cloud Computing Concerns

Perhaps the biggest concerns about cloud computing are security and privacy. The idea of
handing  over  important  data  to  another  company  worries  some  people.  Corporate
executives might hesitate to take advantage of a cloud computing system because they can't
keep their company's information under lock and key.

Privacy  is  another  matter.  If  a  client  can  log  in  from  any  location  to  access  data  and
applications,  it's  possible  the  client's  privacy  could  be  compromised.  Cloud  computing
companies  will  need  to  find  ways  to  protect  client  privacy  by  implementing  reliable
authentication techniques.

A cloud computing system must ensure backup of all its clients' information.

Some  questions  regarding  cloud  computing  are  more  legal.  Does  the  user  or  company
subscribing to the cloud computing service own the data? Does the cloud computing system,
which  provides  the  actual  storage  space,  own  it?  Is  it  possible  for  a  cloud  computing
company  to  deny  a  client  access  to  that  client's  data?  Several  companies,  law  firms  and
universities  are  debating  these  and  other  questions  about  the  nature  of  cloud  computing.
Thus, there are issues relating to data security and privacy, compliance and legal/contractual
issues.

P a g e  | 57

A few examples of cloud computing risks that need to be managed include:

a.  Enterprises  need  to  be  particular  in  choosing  a  provider.  Reputation,  history  and
sustainability  should  all  be  factors  to  consider.  Sustainability  is  of  particular
importance to ensure that services will be available and data can be tracked.

b.  The  cloud  provider  often  takes  responsibility  for  information  handling,  which  is  a
critical  part  of  the  business.  Failure  to  perform  to  agreed-upon  service  levels  can
impact  not  only  confidentiality  but  also  availability,  severely  affecting  business
operations.

c.  The  dynamic  nature  of  cloud  computing  may  result  in  confusion  as  to  where
information  actually  resides.  When  information  retrieval  is  required,  this  may  create
delays.

d.  The  geographical  location  of  data  storage  and  processing  is  not  definite  unlike
traditional data centre. Trans-border data flows, business continuity requirements, log
retention,  data  retention,  audit  trails  are  among  the  issues  that  contribute  to
compliance challenges in Cloud Computing environment.

e.  Third-party  access  to  sensitive  information  creates  a  risk  of  compromise  to
confidential  information.  In  cloud  computing,  this  can  pose  a  significant  threat  to
ensuring  the  protection  of  intellectual  property  (IP),  trade  secrets  and  confidential
customer information.

f.  The  contractual  issues  in  the  cloud  services  can  relate  to  ownership  of  intellectual
property, unilateral contract termination, vendor lock-in, fixing liability and obligations
of Cloud service providers, exit clause,etc.

g.  Public clouds allow high-availability systems to be developed at service levels often
impossible to create in private networks, except at extraordinary costs. The downside
to  this  availability  is  the  potential  for  commingling  of  information  assets  with  other
cloud  customers,  including  competitors.  Compliance  to  regulations  and  laws  in
different geographic regions can be a challenge for enterprises. At this time there is
little legal precedent regarding liability in the cloud. It is critical to obtain proper legal
advice  to  ensure  that  the  contract  specifies  the  areas  where  the  cloud  provider  is
responsible and liable for ramifications arising from potential issues.

h.  Due to the dynamic nature of the cloud, information may not immediately be located
in  the  event  of  a  disaster.  Business  continuity  and  disaster  recovery  plans  must  be
well documented and tested. The cloud provider must understand the role it plays in
terms of backups, incident response and recovery. Recovery time objectives should
be stated in the contract.

Service providers must demonstrate the existence of effective and robust security controls,
assuring customers that their information is properly secured against unauthorized access,
change  and  destruction.  Key  questions  to  decide  are:  What  employees  (of  the  provider)
have access to customer information? Is segregation of duties between provider employees
maintained?  How  are  different  customers’  information  segregated?  What  controls  are  in
place to prevent, detect and react to breaches?

Given that control, security, legal issues on cloud computing are still evolving, a bank needs
to  exercise  caution  and  carry  out  necessary  due  diligence  and  assess  the  risks
comprehensively while considering cloud computing.

CHAPTER 3: IT OPERATIONS

Introduction:

For banks in which information technology (IT) systems are used to manage information, IT
Operations  should  support  processing  and  storage  of  information,  such  that  the  required
information is available in a timely, reliable, secure and resilient manner.

IT  Operations  are  a  set  of  specialized  organizational  capabilities  that  provide  value  to
customers (internal or external) in form of IT services. Capabilities take the form of functions
and processes for managing services over technology lifecycle. IT Operations should ensure
effectiveness  and  efficiency  in  delivery  and  support  of  these  services  to  ensure  value  for
customers.

Scope:

Functions covered as a part of IT Operations are:

−

−

IT Service Management

Infrastructure Management

−  Application Lifecycle Management

−

IT Operations Risk Framework

The Board, Senior Management:

-  Roles and Responsibilities:

Bank’s Board of Directors has ultimate responsibility for oversight over effective functioning
of IT operational functions. Senior management should ensure the implementation of a safe
IT Operation environment. Policies and procedures defined as a part of IT Operations should
support bank’s goals and objectives, as well as statutory requirements.

-  Functional areas, within the preview of these roles, are:

•  Core IT Operations

•  Business Line-specific IT Operations

•  Any Affiliates-related IT Operations

•  Business Partners’ Operations (including that of IT support vendors if any)

The  Board  or  Senior  Management  should  take  into  consideration  the  risk  associated  with
existing  and  planned  IT  operations  and  the  risk  tolerance  and  then  establish  and  monitor
policies for risk management.

Organisational Structure:

IT Operations include business services that are available to internal or external customers
using IT as a service delivery component–such as mobile or internet banking. IT Operations
include  components  that  are  used  to  support  IT  Operations:  service  desk  application,
ticketing and event management tools, etc. Banks may consider including Test and Quality
Assurance  Environment  (besides,  Production  Environment)  within
IT
Operations.

the  scope  of

a)  Service  Desk:  The  service  desk  is  the  primary  point  of  contact  (Single  Point  of
Contact  or  SPOC)  for  internal  and  external  customers.  Besides  handling  incidents

•  Contributing to problem identification

•  Performing user satisfaction surveys

A structure for the Service Desk that allows optimum resource utilization would include:

•  Local Service Desk

•  Central Service Desk

•  Virtual Service Desk

•  Follow  the  Sun  i.e.  in  time  zones  such  that  service  desk  is  available  for  assistance

and recording of incidents round the clock

•  Specialized Service Desk Groups

b)  IT Operations Management

i.

IT Operations management is a function which is primarily responsible for the day-to-
day  management  and  maintenance  of  an  organisation’s  IT  infrastructure,  ensuring
service delivery to the agreed level as defined by Service Level Agreement (SLA).

ii.

IT Operations management can have following functions:

•  Operational  Control:  Oversee  the  execution  and  monitoring  of  operational
activities  and  events  in  IT  infrastructure  which  is  within  the  preview  of  IT
operations.    Operational  control  activities  are  normally  carried  out  by  Network
Operations Centre (NOC) or Operations Bridge. Beside execution and monitoring
of routine tasks operation control also involve the following activities :

-  Console Management

-

Job Scheduling

-  Backup and Restoration

-  Print and Output Management

-  General Maintenance Activities

P a g e  | 60

•  Facility  Management:  It  refers  to  management  of  physical  IT  environment  of

data centre, computers rooms and recovery sites

iii. Operations Management Structure: For all practical reasons, application management and
infrastructure  management  teams  should  be  part  of  IT  operations. As,  these  functions
manage and execute operational activities, whereas others delegate these to dedicate IT
operations function.

c)  Application Management:

 It involves handling and management of application as it goes through the entire life-cycle.
The  life-cycle  encompasses  both  application  development  and  application  management
activities. Sub-activities that can be defined for application management functions are:

•  Application Development: It is concerned with activities needed to plan, design and
build an application that ultimately is used by a part of the organisation to address a
business  requirement.  This  also  includes  application  acquisition,  purchase,  hosting
and provisioning

•  Application  Maintenance/Management:  It  focuses  on  activities  that  are  involved

with the deployment, operation, support and optimisation of the application

Application Management related functions may include the following:

•  Managing operational applications, whether vendor developed, or off-the-shelf or in-

house

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

•

It acts as a custodian of technical knowledge and expertise related to managing and
supporting  applications.  It  ensures  that  the  technical  knowledge  and  expertise
required  to  design,  develop,  test,  manage  and  improve  IT  services  are  identified,
developed and refined. Therefore, it participates in IT operation management

It ensures that appropriate resources are effectively trained and deployed to deliver,
build, transit, operate and improve the technology required to manage and support IT
services

It defines and executes training programmes

It  documents  skill  sets  available  within  an  organisation  and  skills  that  need  to  be
developed to manage application management as function

It  defines  standards  to  be  adapted  when  defining  new  application  architecture  and
involvement in design and build of new services

It assesses the risk involved in an application architecture

It records feedbacks on availability and capacity management activities

It  designs  and  performs  tests  for  functionality,  performance  and  manageability  of  IT
services

It defines and manages event management tools

It  participates  in  incident,  problem,  performance,  change  and  release  management,
and in resource fulfillment

•

It provides information on the Configuration Management System

Application  Management  Structure:  Though  activities  to  manage  applications  are
generic  and  consistent  across  applications;  application  management  function,  for  all
practical  reasons,  is  not  performed  by  a  single  department  or  group.  It  consists  of
technical areas as per technical skill sets and expertise. Some of these can be:

P a g e  | 61

•  Financial application

•

Infrastructure applications

•  Messaging and collaborative applications

•  Web portal or web applications

•  Contact centre applications

•  Function-specific applications

d)  Infrastructure Management

It  is  the  function  primarily  responsible  for  providing  technical  expertise  and  overall
management of the IT infrastructure. Its primary objective is to assist in plan, implement and
maintenance  of  a  stable  technical  infrastructure  in  order  to  support  an  organisation’s
business processes.

Infrastructure Management can have following functions:

i.  Manage IT infrastructure components for an environment, which falls within the preview

of IT operations

ii.  It acts as a custodian of technical knowledge and expertise, related to the management
of IT infrastructure. It ensures that technical knowledge and expertise required to design,
develop, test, manage and improve IT services are identified, developed and refined

iii.  It  ensures  appropriate  resources  are  effectively  trained  and  deployed  to  deliver,  build,
transit,  operate  and  improve  the  technology  required  to  deliver  and  support  IT
infrastructure

iv.  It helps define and execute training programmes

v.  It  helps  document  skill  sets  available  within  an  organisation  and  skills  needed  to  be

developed to manage infrastructure management as function

vi.  Definition of standards to be adapted when defining new IT architecture and involvement

in the design and build of new services

vii. Risk assessment for IT infrastructure architecture

viii. Feedbacks to availability and capacity management activities

ix.  Designing  and  performing  tests  for  functionality,  performance  and  manageability  of  IT

services

x.  Definition and management of event management tools

xi.  Participation  in  incident,  problem,  performance,  change  and  release  management  and

resource fulfillment

xii. Infrastructure  management

function  should  provide

information  or  manage

for

configuration Management System

Infrastructure  Management  Structure:  For  all  practical  reasons,  infrastructure  management
function is not performed by a single department or group, it consist of technical areas as per
the technical skill sets and expertise, some of these are:

•  Mainframe management team

•  Server management team

•  Storage management team

•  Network support team

•  Desktop support team

P a g e  | 62

•  Database management team

•  Middleware management team

•  Directory services team

•

Internet team

•  Messaging team

•

IP-based telephony team

Components of IT operations framework:

a)  Risk Management

 Banks  should  analyse  their  IT  Operation  environment,  including  technology,  human
resources  and  implemented  processes,  to  identify  threats  and  vulnerabilities.  They  should
conduct a periodic risk assessment which should identify:

•

Internal and external risks

•  Risks  associated  with  individual  platforms,  systems,  or  processes,  as  well  as

automated processing units

While  identifying  the  risks,  a  risk  assessment  process  should  quantify  the  probability  of  a
threat and vulnerability, and the financial consequences of such an event. Banks should also
consider the inter-dependencies between risk elements, as threats and vulnerabilities have
the  potential  to  quickly  compromise  inter-connected  and  inter-dependent  systems  and
processes.

Banks  should  implement  a  cost-effective  and  risk-focused  environment.    The  risk  control
environment  should  provide  guidance,  accountability  and  enforceability,  while  mitigating
risks.

Risk  Categorisation:  As  a  part  of  risk  identification  and  assessment,  banks  should
identify  events  or  activities  that  could  disrupt  operations,  or  negatively  affect  the
reputation  or  earnings,  and  assess  compliance  to  regulatory  requirements.  Risks
identified can be broadly categorised into following categories:

•  Strategic Failures: That might include improper implementation, failure of supplier,
inappropriate  definition  of  requirements,  incompatibility  with  existing  application
infrastructure etc. It will also include regulatory compliance

•  Design Failures: It might include inadequate project management, cost and time

overruns, programming errors and data migration failures among others

•  Transition Failures: It might include inadequate capacity planning, inappropriately
defined  availability  requirements,  SLA  /  OLA  /  Underpinning  contracts  not
appropriately defined and information security breaches, among others

Risk Mitigation: Once the organisation has identified, analyzed and categorized the risks,
organisation should define following attributes for each risk component:

•  Probability of Occurrence;

•  Financial Impact;

•  Reputational Impact;

•  Regulatory Compliance Impact;

•  Legal Impact.

Beside above specified attributes, an organisation should also consider these:

P a g e  | 63

•  Lost revenues

•  Loss of market share

•  Non-compliance of regulatory requirements

•  Litigation probability

•  Data recovery expenses

•  Reconstruction expenses

These, along with the business process involved, should be used to prioritise risk mitigation
actions and control framework.

b)  IT Operations Processes

i)

IT Strategy

Processes within IT Strategy provide guidance to identify, select and prioritise services that
are aligned to business requirements. IT strategy, as a framework, provides feedback to IT
Operations  on  the  services  to  be  supported  and  their  underlying  business  processes  and
prioritisation of these services, etc.

A  well-defined  IT  Strategy  framework  will  assist  IT  Operations  in  supporting  IT  services  as
required by the business and defined in OLA / SLAs.

IT Strategy processes provide guidelines that can be used by the banks to design, develop,
and implement IT Operation not only as an organisational capability but as a strategic asset.

a)  Financial  Management:  It  provides  mechanism  and  techniques  to  IT  operations  to
quantify in financial terms, value of IT services it supports, value of assets underlying
the provisioning of these services, and qualification of operational forecasting.

Advantages of implementing Financial Management process are:

•  Assists in decision-making

•  Speed of changes

•  Service Portfolio Management

•  Financial compliance and control

•  Operational control

•  Value capture and creation

b)  Service Valuation

It  is  the  mechanism  that  can  be  considered  by  banks  to  quantify  services,  which  are
available  to  customers  (internal  or  external)  and  supported  by  IT  operations  in  financial
terms.  It  assists  IT  Operation  functions  to  showcase  the  involvement  of  function  in
supporting the bank's core business.

Financial  Management  uses  Service  Valuation  to  quantify  financial  terms,  value  of  IT
services  supported  by  IT  Operations.  It  provides  a  blueprint  from  which  businesses  can
comprehend  what  is  actually  delivered  to  them  from  IT.  Combined  with  Service  Level
Management,  Service  Valuation  is  the  means  to  a  mutual  agreement  with  businesses,
regarding what a service is, what its components are, and its cost and worth.

Service  Valuation  quantifies,  in  financial  terms,  funding  sought  by  a  business  and  IT  for
services  delivered,  based  on  the  agreed  value  of  those  services.  The  activity  involves
identifying  cost  baseline  for  services  and  then  quantifying  the  perceived  valued,  added  by
the provider’s service assets in order to conclude a final service value.

Service Valuation will have two components, these being:

P a g e  | 64

i)  Provisioning  Value:  The  actual  underlying  cost  of  IT,  related  to  provisioning  a
service, including all fulfillment elements–tangible and intangible.  Input comes from
financial systems and consists of payment of actual resources consumed by the IT in
the provisioning of services. This cost element includes items such as:

−  Hardware and software license cost

−  Annual maintenance fees for hardware and software

−  Personnel resources used in the support or maintenance of the services

−  Utilities, data centre or other facilities charge

−  Taxes, capital or interest charges

−  Compliance costs

ii)  Service  Value  Potential:  Is  the  value-added  component  based  on  a  customer’s
perception  of  value  from  the  service  or  expected  marginal  utility  and  warranty
from using the services in comparison with what is possible using the customer’s
own assets.

c)  Portfolio Management

It provides guidelines that can be considered by banks for governing investments in service
management  across  an  enterprise  and  managing  them  for  value.  Portfolio  management
contains  information  for  all  existing services,  as  well  as  every  proposed  service–those  that
are in conceptual phase.

Every service, which is a part of service portfolio, should include a business case, which is a
model of what a service is expected to achieve. It is the justification for pursuing a course of
action to meet stated organisational goals. Business case links back to service strategy and
funding. It is the assessment of a service management in terms of potential benefits and the
resources  and  capabilities  required  to  provision  and  maintain  the  service.  Portfolio
Management framework defined by the banks should highlight controls, which are defined to
develop  an  IT  Service  from  conceptual  phase  to  go-live  phase  and  then  to  transition  to
production environment. During the development of  IT services financial impact of the new
service on IT Operation should also be ascertained which will assist IT Operations in Service
Validation.

d)  Demand Management

Demand  Management  process  provides  guidelines  which  can  be  used  by  banks  to
understand  the  business  processes  IT  operations  supports  to  identify,  analyse,  and  codify
Patterns  of  business  activities  (PBA)  to  provide  sufficient  basic  for  capacity  requirement.
Analysing  and  tracking  the  activity  patterns  of  the  business  process  makes  it  possible  to
predict  demand  for  services.    It  is  also  possible  to  predict  demand  for  underlying  service
assets that support these services.

Demand  Management  guidelines  should  also  take  into  consideration  IT  Operations
involvement in development of service from conceptual phase to go to the live phase, so that
there is a transparency of demand of new service in IT Operations.

Ii) Design

The design phase of the IT operations provides the guidelines and processes, which can be
used  by  the  banks  to  manage  the  change  in  the  business  landscape.  Components  which
should be considered when designing a new IT service or making a change to the existing IT
service are:

•  Business Processes
•
•  Service-level Agreements

IT Services

P a g e  | 65

IT Infrastructure
IT Environment
Information Data

•
•
•
•  Applications
•  Support Services
•  Support Teams
•  Suppliers

i)  Service  design:  This  should  not  consider  components  in  isolation,  but  must  also
their

the  components  and

consider
relationship  between  each  of
dependencies on any other component or service.

the

ii)  Design  phase:  Provides  a  set  of  processes  and  guidelines  that  can  be  used  by
banks  to  design  IT  services,  supported  by  IT  operations,  that  satisfies  business
objectives,  compliance  requirements  and  risk  and  security  requirements.  The
processes  also  provide  guidelines  to  identify  and  manage  risks  and  to  design
secure and resilient IT services.

e)  Service Catalogue Management

Over the years, banks' IT infrastructure has grown and developed. In order to establish an
accurate IT landscape, it is recommended that an IT Service Catalogue is defined, produced
and  maintained.  It  can  be  considered  as  a  repository  that  provides  information  on  all  IT
services supported by IT Operations framework.

The Service Catalogue Management process provides guidelines, used by banks to define
and manage service catalogue, which provides a consistent and accurate information on all
IT  services  available  to  customers  (internal  or  external).  It  also  ensures  that  the  service
catalogue is available to users, who are approved to access it. It should contain details of all
services that are in production, as well as the services that are being prepared for transition.
Banks may consider following attributes to be included into the service catalogue:

1.  Definition of Service

2.  Categorization of Service (business application and IT support)

3.  Service Criticality

4.  Disaster Recovery Class

5.  Service-level Agreement Parameters

6.  Service Environment (Production, Testing, Quality Assurance, Staging, etc.)

7.  IT Support Status (Operational and Transaction, etc.)

8.  Configuration Management Group

9.  Incident Management Group

10. Problem Management Group

11. Change and Release Management Group

12. Service Owner

13. Service-level Manager

14. Principal Business Activities Details

15. Interdependency on Configuration Items

16. Interdependency on Service Portfolio

Service catalogue provides details of services available to customers such as intended use,

P a g e  | 66

business processes they enable and the level and quality of service the customer can expect
from  each  service.    Banks  can  also  consider  incorporating  “charge  back  mechanism”,  as
defined in financial management into the service catalogue.

A Service catalogue has two aspects:

i)  Business  Service  Catalogue:  It  contains  details  of  all  IT  services  delivered  to  a
customer,  together  with  relationships  with  business  units  and  business  processes  that
rely  on  IT  services.  This  is  the  customer  view  of  the  catalogue.  Business  Service
Catalogue facilitates development of robust Service Level Management process.

ii)  Technical  Service  Catalogue:  It  contains  details  of  all  IT  services  delivered  to  a
customer,  together  with  his  or  her  relationship  with  supporting  and  shared  services,
relationship to configuration items (CIs). CIs can be a service asset or component, or any
other item that is under control of configuration management. Depending on established
strategy configuration, an item may vary widely in complexity, size and type. It can range
from  entire  services  or  systems  to  a  single  software  module  or  a  minor  software
component.  (Configuration  Items  are  explained  in  details  in  “Service  Assets  and
Configuration  Management”  section  of  the  guidelines.)  It  facilitates  the  development  of
the  relationship  between  services,  underlying  CIs,  SLAs  and  OLAs,  and  the  support
groups, which support services throughout its life-cycle.

f)  Service Level Management

This  process  defines  the  framework  that  can  be  used  by  banks  to  plan,  co-ordinate  and
draft,  agree,  monitor  and  report  service  attributes  used  to  measure  the  service  quality.  Its
framework  also  includes  guidelines  for  ongoing  review  of  service  achievements  to  ensure
that  the  required  and  cost-justifiable  service  quality  is  maintained  and  improved.  Beside
current  services  and  SLAs,  this  management  provides  guidelines  to  ensure  that  new
requirements are captured. That new or changed services and SLAs are developed to match
the business needs and expectations.

i) Service Level Management process should be able to meet the following objectives:

•  Define, document, agree, monitor, measure, report and review the level of IT services

•  Ensure specific and quantifiable targets are defined for IT services

•  Ensure that IT Operations and consumers have clear, unambiguous expectations of

the level of services to be delivered

•  Ensure  that  pro-active  measures,  to  improve  the  level  of  service  delivered,  are

implemented if cost-justified

ii) While defining SLM framework for banks, the following aspects should also be considered

•  Operational-level  agreement  to  ensure  that  Operational  Level  Agreements  (OLAs)
with other support groups are defined and developed; these OLAs should be in line
with SLAs which it supports

•  Underpinning supplier contract to ensure all underpinning supplier contracts with the
vendors  or  suppliers  are  defined  and  developed:  these  contracts  should  be  in  line
with SLAs, which it supports

iii)  While  defining  Service  Level  Agreement  as  a  part  of  Service  Level  Management
framework, the following options can be considered:

•  Service  based  SLA:  Its  structure  covers  attributes  for  single  service  across  an

organisation. For instance, SLA for internet banking service

•  Customer based SLA: The structure covers attributes for all services for a defined

set of customers. For instance, SLA for SMEs customers

P a g e  | 67

•  Multi-Level SLA: Multi-level SLA structure can be defined as per the organizational

hierarchy. For instance, SLA for corporate offices, branches and head offices

Attributes that are included in SLAs should be ones which can effectively be monitored and
measured.   Attributes  which  are  included  in  the  SLAs  can  be  categorised  into  operational,
response, availability and security attributes. Service Level Management framework should
also  define  guidelines  for  reviews  of  Service  Level  Agreements,  Operational  Level
Agreements, and underpinning contracts to ensure that they are aligned to business needs
and strategy. These should ensure that services covered, and targets for each, are relevant.
And  that  nothing  significant  is  changed  that  invalidates  the  agreement  in  any  way.  Service
Level Management framework defined should also have guidelines defined for logging and
management, including escalation of complaints and compliments.

g)  Capacity Management

The process provides the framework and guidelines that can be adapted by banks to ensure
that  cost-justifiable  IT  capacity  exists  and  matches  to  current-  and  future-agreed  business
requirements as identified in Service Level Agreement.

The Capacity Management process provides guidelines to:

•  Produce  and  maintain  capacity  plan  that  reflects  the  current  and  future  business

requirements

•  Manage  service  performance  so  that  it  meets  or  exceeds  the  agreed  performance

targets

•  Diagnosis  and  resolution  of  performance  and  capacity-related  incidents  and

problems

•  Assess  impact  of  all  changes  on  capacity  plan  and  performance  of  IT  services

supported by IT Operations

•  Ensure  that  pro-active  measures  are  undertaken  to  improve  the  performance  of

services, whenever it is cost-justifiable.

One  of  the  key  activities  defined  as  a  part  of  capacity  management  process  is  to  produce
and maintain, at an ongoing basis, the capacity plan, which depicts current level of resource
utilization  and  service  performance.  Capacity  plans  can  also  include  forecasting  future
requirements to support business activities. The process can be subdivided into three:

i.  Business Capacity Management: Defines guidelines for translating business-need
plans  into  requirements  for  IT  services  and  supporting  infrastructure,  ensuring  that
the  future  business  requirements  for  IT  services  are  quantified,  designed,  planned
and implemented. Inputs for future IT requirements come from the Service Portfolio
and Demand Management.

ii.

Service  Capacity  Management:  This  defines  guidelines  for  management,  control
and  prediction  of  end-to-end  performance  and  capacity  of  live  and  operational  IT
service usage and workloads. It provides guidelines to ensure that the performance
of IT services is monitored and measured.

iii.  Component Capacity Management: It defines guidelines to identify and understand
the  performance,  capacity  and  utilization  of  each  individual  component  within  a
technology  used  to  support  IT  services,  including  infrastructure,  environment,  data
and applications.

A  major  difference  between  sub-processes  is  in  the  data  that  is  being  monitored  and
collected.  For example, the level of utilization of individual components in the infrastructure:
processors, disks and network links will be under Component Capacity Management. While
transaction
times  will  be  under  Service  Capacity
Management.  Business  Capacity  Management  will  be  concerned  with  data,  specific  to

throughput  rates  and  response

P a g e  | 68

business  volumes.  Banks  adapting  capacity  management  process  should  ensure  that  its
framework  encompass  all  areas  of  technology  (hardware,  software,  human  resource,
facilities, etc.)

h)  Availability Management

Availability  and  reliability  of  IT  services  can  directly  influence  customer  satisfaction  and
reputation  of  banks.  Therefore Availability  Management  is  essential  in  ensuring  that  the  IT
delivers  the  “right  level”  of  service  required  by  the  business  to  satisfy  its  objectives.  The
process provides framework and guidelines that can be adapted by banks to ensure that the
level  of  service  availability  (for  all  services)  is  matched,  or  exceeds  the  current  and  future
requirements, as defined in the Service Level Agreement.

Availability Management process provides guidelines so that banks can:

•  Produce  and  maintain  an  appropriate  up-to-date  Availability  Plan  that  reflects  the

current and future needs of the business

•  Ensure  that  service  availability  achievements  meet  or  exceed  agreed  targets,  by

managing services and resources-related availability targets

•  Assist with diagnosis and resolution of availability-related incidents and problems

•  Ensure  that  pro-active  measures  to  improve  the  availability  of  services  are

implemented wherever it is cost justifiable to do so

When  implementing  Availability  Management  processes,  banks  should  consider  including
the following:

i.  All  operational  services  and  technology,  supported  by  IT  Operations  function  and  for

which there is a formal SLA

ii.  New services where Service Level Requirement and Agreement have been established

iii.  Aspects of IT's services and components that may impact availability, which may include

training, skills, process effectiveness, procedures and tools

Availability Management process has two key elements:

i.  Reactive  activities:  The  reactive  aspect  of  availability  management  involves
monitoring, measuring, analysis and management of events, incidents, problems and
changes, involving unavailability

ii.

Proactive  activities:  This  aspect  involves  planning,  design  and  improvement  of
availability

Attributes that can be used by the banks for reporting availability of IT services, can be:

•  Availability: The ability of a service, component or CI, to perform the agreed function

when required.

•  Availability (%) = ----------------------------------------- x100

Agreed Service Time - Downtime

Agreed Service Time

Downtime should only be included in the above calculation, when it occurs within the
“Agreed Service Time”.

•  Mean  Time  Between  Service  Incidents  (MTBSI):  MTBSI  refers  to  how  long  a

service; component or CI can perform its agreed function without interruption.

Available time in hours

•  MTBSI =       -------------------------------------

P a g e  | 69

Number of Breaks

•  Mean  Time  Between  Failures  (MTBF):  MTBF  refers  to  how  long  a  service;

component or CI can perform its agreed function without reporting a failure.

                 Available time in hours – Total downtime in Hours

MTBF =       -----------------------------------------------------------------

                                        Number of breaks

Mean Time Between Failures (MTBF): is the mean time between the recovery from one
incident  and  occurrence  of  the  next  incident,  it  is  also  known  as  uptime.  This  metric
relates to the reliability of the IT Service supported by IT Operations.

•  Mean Time to Repair (MTTR): MTTR refers to how quickly and effectively a service,

component or CI can be restored to normal working after failure.

        Total downtime in Hours

MTTR =   -----------------------------------

Number of breaks

Mean  Time  to  Repair  (MTTR):  This  is  the  average  time  between  occurrence  of  a  fault
and  service  recovery.  It  is  also  known  as  downtime.  This  metric  relates  to  the
recoverability and serviceability of the IT Services supported by IT Operations.

Vital Business Functions

When  defining  availability  targets  for  a  business  service,  banks  should  consider  identifying
Vital  Business  Function  (VBF).  VBF  represents  critical  business  elements  of  a  process
supported by IT services. For example, an ATM will have following business functions:

i.  Cash dispensing

ii.  Reconciliation with the relevant account

iii.  Statement printing.

Out  of  these  three,  cash  dispensing  and  reconciliation  should  be  considered  as  vital
business functions, influencing the availability design and associated costs.

i)  Supplier Management

Complex  business  demands  require  extensive  skills  and  capabilities  from  IT  to  support
business  processes,  therefore  collaboration  with  service  providers  and  value  networks  are
an  integral  part  of  end-to-end  business  solution.  Supplier  Management  process  provides
framework and guidelines that can be used by banks to manage relationships with vendors,
suppliers and contractors.  This framework ensures that suppliers and services they provide
are  managed  to  support  IT  service  targets  and  business  expectations. The  purpose  of  this
management  process  is  to  obtain  value  for  money  from  suppliers,  and  to  ensure  that
suppliers  perform  to  the  targets  contained  within  contracts  and  agreements,  while
conforming to all terms and conditions.

Supplier Management process provides guidelines which can be used by the banks to:

•

Implement and enforce supplier policies

•  Maintenance of supplier and contact database

P a g e  | 70

•  Suppler and contact categorization and risk assessment

•  Supplier and contract evaluation and selection

•  Development, negotiation and agreement of contracts

•  Contract review, renewal and termination

•  Management of suppliers and supplier performance

•  Agreement and implementation of service and supplier improvement plans

•  Maintenance of standard contracts, terms and conditions

•  Management of contractual dispute resolution

•  Management of sub-contracted suppliers

iii) Transition

The transition phase provides frameworks and processes that may be utilised by banks to:

•  Evaluate  service  capabilities  and  risk  profile  of  new  or  changes  service  before  it  is

released into production environment

•  Evaluate  and  maintain  integrity  of  all  identified  service  assets  and  configuration  items

required to support the service

Service Asset and Configuration Management

Service Asset  and  Configuration  Management  process  provides  framework  and  guidelines
that  can  be  used  by  the  banks  to  manage  service  assets  and  configuration  items  that
supports business services.

The framework provides guidelines to:

•

Identify, control, record, audit and verify service assets and configuration items, including
service baseline version controls their attributes and relationships.

•  Manage  and  protect  integrity  of  service  assets  and  configuration  items  through  the
service  lifecycle  by  ensuring  only  authorised  assets  are  used  and  only  authorised
changes are made.

•  Ensure  integrity  of  configuration  items  required  to  support  business  services  and  IT
infrastructure  by  establishing  and  maintaining  an  accurate  and  complete  Configuration
Management System.

•  Provide  accurate  information  of  configuration  items  to  assist  in  change  and  release

management process.

Service  asset  management  manages  assets  across  its  lifecycle  from  acquisition  through
disposal.  Implementation  of  Service  Asset  and  Configuration  Management  framework  has
cost and resources implications and therefore strategic discussions needs to be made about
the  priorities  to  be  addressed.    For  instance  banks  can  decide  on  initially  focusing  on  the
basic  IT  assets  (hardware  and  software)  and  the  services  and  assets  that  are  business
critical or covered by legal regulatory compliance.

Components  that  can  be  considered  as  part  of  Service  Asset  and  Configuration
Management are:

i.  Configuration Items: These can be a service asset or component, or any item that
is under the control of configuration management. Depending on established strategy

P a g e  | 71

configuration,  the  item  may  vary  widely  in  complexity,  size  and  type.  It  can  range
from  an  entire  service  or  system  to  a  single  software  module  or  a  minor  software
component.

If desired, banks can define a hierarchical structure for configuration items.  For instance
banks  can  define  Core  Banking  as  a  configuration  item  which  can  have  different
application as a subset Configuration Item of the Core Banking configuration item.  Each
configuration item can have modules as sub set which can have two configuration item,
these  being  hosting  and  application  support.    Hosting  can  then  be  further  sub-divided
into  configuration  item  that  can  be  servers,  operating  systems,  databases,  network
components.

ii.  Configuration Management System: To manage large and complex IT environment
banks  may  consider  implementation  of  supporting  system  known  as  Configuration
Management  System.    Beside  holding  information  about  configuration  items,  their
components  and
items  Configuration
Management System can also be used to correlate services and configuration items;
this kind of snapshot will assist in proactively identifying incidents, events etc.

relationship  between

configuration

iii.  Secure  libraries:  Secure  library  is  a  collection  of  software,  electronic  or  document
CIs.  Access to items in a secure library is restricted.  The secure library is used for
controlling and releasing components throughout the service lifecycle.

iv.  Definitive Media Library: Definitive media library (DML) is a secure library that may
be  used  to  store  definitive  authorised  versions  of  all  media  CIs.    It  stores  master
copies of versions that have passed quality assurance checks.

v.  Configuration  Baseline:  This  baseline  is  the  configuration  of  a  service,  product  or
infrastructure that has been formally reviewed and agreed on, that thereafter serves
as the basis for further activities and that can be changed only through formal change
procedure.    Configuration  baseline  captures  and  represents  a  set  of  configuration
items that are related to each other.

vi.  Snapshot: It defines the current state of configuration items or an environment.

vii.  Change Management: This process provides guidelines which can be used by the
banks  for  handling  changes  to  ensure  that  the  changes  are  recorded,  assessed,
authorised, prioritised, planned, tested, implemented, documented and reviewed in a
controlled  manner  and  environment.  The  primary  objective  of
the  change
management procedures is to ensure assessment of:

•  Risks

•  Change authorization

•  Business Continuity

•  Change impact

iv) Operations

This  phase,  as  a  part  of  Service  Management  lifecycle,  is  responsible  for  executing  and
performing  processes  that  optimise  the  cost  of  the  quality  of  services.  As  a  part  of  the
organisation,  it's  responsible  for  enabling  businesses  to  meets  objectives.  As  a  part  of
technology,  it's  responsible  for  effective  functioning  of  components  that  support  business
services.

Event Management

Event  Management  process  provides  the  guidelines  which  can  be  used  by  the  banks  to
define  the  framework  for  monitoring  all  the  relevant  events  that  occurs  through  the  IT

P a g e  | 72

infrastructure.  It  provides  the  entry  point  for  the  execution  of  many  Service  Operations
processes and activities.

Event can be defined as any detectable or discernible occurrence that has significance for
the  management  of  the  IT  infrastructure,  or  delivery  of  IT  services.  Event  Management
framework when defined will have two mechanisms for monitoring, these are:

•  Active  Monitoring:  Active  monitoring  is  related  to  polling  of  business  significant
Configuration Items to determine their status and availability.  Any diversion from normal
status should be reported to appropriate team for action.

•  Passive  Monitoring:  Passive  monitoring  detects  and  correlate  operational  alerts  or

communications generated by Configuration Items.

Event Management can be applied to any aspect of Service Management that needs to be
controlled.  These components can be:

•  Configuration Items

•  Environment conditions

•  Software licence monitoring

•  Security breaches

Event Management portfolio can have different kind of event, some of these are:

•

Informational:  Events  signifying  regular  operations  for  instance  notification  that  a
scheduled job has completed

•  Warning:  Events  signifying  diversion  from  normal  course  of  action,  for  instance  a  user
attempting  to  login  with  incorrect  password.  Exceptional  events  will  require  further
investigation to determine an environment which may have led to an exception

•  Exceptions: Events, which are unusual. Events may require closer monitoring. In some
case the condition will resolve itself. For instance, unusual combinations of workloads as
they  are  completed,  normal  operations  will  restore.    In  other  cases,  operations
intervention will be required if the situation is repeated

Incident Management

An incident is an unplanned interruption to an IT service, or the reduction in the quality of an
IT service. Failure of a configuration item that has not yet impacted service shall also be an
incident.

Incident Management process provides guidelines that can be implemented by the banks for
the  management  of  incidents  so  that      restoration  of  service  operations  as  quickly  as
possible  and  to  minimise  adverse  impact  on  business  operations. The  primary  objective  of
the Incident Management procedures is to ensure best possible level of service quality and
availability.

Problem Management

Problem Management process provides a framework, which can be implemented by banks
to  minimise  the  adverse  impact  of  incidents  on  the  IT  Infrastructure  and  the  business  by
identifying  root  cause,  logging  known  errors,  providing  and  communicating  workarounds,
finding permanent solutions, and preventing recurrence of incidents related to these errors.
Problem Management increases stability and integrity of the infrastructure.

Problem  Management  process  includes  activities  required  to  carry  out  the  root  causes  of
incidents  and
these  underlying  problems.  Problem
management  procedures  also  include  implementation  of  the  resolution  through  Change

appropriate turnaround and resolutions to incidents that cannot be resolved due to business
cases, or technical short falls. Periodic trend analysis of the problems in respect of systems
or customer facing channels may be carried out and appropriate action taken.

Access Management

Access Management process provides the guidelines, which can be implemented by banks
to  limit  access  to  IT  services  only  to  those  individuals  and  applications  that  are  duly
authorised  based  on  organisational  policies  and  standards.  Access  Management  enables

CHAPTER 4 – IT SERVICES OUTSOURCING

Introduction

In India, as banks augment growth and expand business, there is an increasing reliance on
external service providers as partners in achieving the growth targets and as effective cost
alternatives.

'Outsourcing' may be defined as a bank's use of a third party (either an affiliated entity within
a corporate group or an entity that is external to the corporate group) to perform activities on
a continuing basis that would normally be undertaken by the bank itself, now or in the future.
‘Continuing basis' includes agreements for a limited period.

The  benefits  of  outsourcing  include  efficiencies  in  operations,  increased  ability  to  acquire
and  support  current  technology  and  tide  over  the  risk  of  obsolescence,  increased  time
availability  for  management  to  focus  on  key  management  functions,  shorter  lead  time  in
delivering  services  to  customers,  better  quality  of  services,  and  stronger  controls  among
others.

Common areas for Outsourcing

Outsourcing  has  been  a  constant  theme  in  banking  technology  over  at  least  the  past  ten
years,  as  banking  has  become  more  technology  intensive  and  the  required  scale  of
investment has grown exponentially. Many operations have been outsourced to Third party
vendors  comprising  external  vendors  and  specialized  subsidiaries.  Service  providers  today
may be a technology company or specialist outsourcing manager. This decision to outsource
should fit into the institution’s overall strategic plan and corporate objectives.

Common areas where Banks have outsourced functions include:

•  Technology Operations

o  Technology Infrastructure Management, Maintenance and Support
o  Application Development, Maintenance and Testing

•  Banking Operations

o  Sourcing, Leads Generation
o  Cash Management and Collections
o  Customer Service helpdesk / call center services
o  Transaction Processing including payments, loans, deposits
o  Activities such as Debit card printing and dispatch, verifications, etc.

•  Marketing and Research
•  Fiduciary and Trading activities

Role of the Board and Senior  Management

The  Board  and  senior  management  are  ultimately  responsible  for  ‘outsourcing  operations’
and  for  managing  risks  inherent  in  such  outsourcing  relationships.  Whereas  an  institution
may  delegate  its  day-to-day  operational  duties  to  a  service  provider,  responsibilities  for
effective due diligence, oversight and management of outsourcing and accountability for all
outsourcing decisions continue to rest with the Bank, Board and senior management. Board
and  senior  management  have  the  responsibility  to  institute  an  effective  governance
mechanism and risk management process for all outsourced operations.

The Board is responsible for:

P a g e  | 75

•

Instituting an appropriate governance mechanism for outsourced processes, comprising
of  risk  based  policies  and  procedures,  to  effectively  identify,  measure,  monitor  and
control risks associated with outsourcing in an end to end manner

•  Defining  approval  authorities  for  outsourcing  depending  on  nature  of  risks  in  and

materiality of outsourcing

•  Assessing management competencies to develop sound and responsive outsourcing risk
management  policies  and  procedures  commensurate  with  the  nature,  scope,  and
complexity of outsourcing arrangements

•  Undertaking  a  periodic  review  of  outsourcing  strategies  and  all  existing  material

outsourcing arrangements

Senior management is responsible for:

•  Evaluating  the  risks  and  materiality  of  all  prospective  outsourcing  based  on  the

framework developed by the Board

•  Developing  sound  outsourcing  policies  and  procedures  for  implementation  by  Line

Managers

•  Periodically reviewing the effectiveness of policies and procedures
•  Communicating significant risks in outsourcing to the Board on a periodic basis
•  Ensuring  an  independent  review  and  audit  in  accordance  with  approved  policies  and

procedures

•  Ensuring contingency plans have been developed and tested adequately

Various components/aspects relating to outsourcing:

A reference may also be made to “Guidelines on Managing Risks and Code of Conduct in
Outsourcing of Financial Services by Banks” (circular no: DBOD.NO.BP.40/21.04.158/ 2006-
07 dated November 3, 2006) issued by RBI. Aspects relating to IT services outsourcing may
also be incorporated as part of outsourcing policy of a bank.

1.  ‘Material’ Outsourcing

Banks  need  to  assess  the  degree  of  ‘materiality’  inherent  in  the  outsourced  functions.
Whether  an  outsourcing  arrangement  is  ‘material’  to  the  business  context  or  not  is  a
qualitative  judgment  and  may  be  determined  on  the  basis  criticality  of  service,  process,  or
technology to the overall business objectives.

Outsourcing  of  non-financial  processes,  such  as  technology  operations,  is  ‘material’  and  if
disrupted  has  the  potential  to  significantly  impact  business  operations,  reputation  and
stability of the Bank. Where a Bank relies on third party employees to perform key banking
functions  such  as  applications  processing,  verifications,  approvals,  etc.,  on  a  continuous
basis, such outsourcing may  also  be  construed  as  ‘material’,  whether or  not  the  personnel
are located within the premises of the Bank. However, extant RBI guidelines on outsourcing
indicate activities which cannot be outsourced and need to be carried out by the bank. These
include  Internal  Audit,  Compliance  function,  and  decision  making  functions  like  KYC
compliance, loans sanctioning, and managing investment portfolio. These need to be kept in
view.

Criteria  that  may  be  considered  in  determining  the  materiality  of  proposed  outsourcing
include the following:

•  Size and scale of operations which are outsourced

P a g e  | 76

•  Potential  impact  of  outsourcing  on  parameters  such  as  cost  of  outsourcing  as  a
proportion  of  total  operating  costs,  earnings,  liquidity,  solvency,  funding  capital,  risk
profile, among others, for the Bank

•  Nature of functions outsourced
•  Nature and extent of data sharing involved. For e.g., where outsourcing involves sharing

of customer data, the engagement may be ‘material’

•  Degree/extent  of  control  and  oversight  exercised  by  the  bank  on  vendor  managed
processes. For e.g., the ability of bank staff to design and influence day to day operations
and decision making, whether bank staff is able to exercise sufficient oversight over the
day to day activities performed by outsourced agencies

•  Degree  of  control  exercised  by  banks  on  outsourced  entities,  regardless  of  a

•

conglomerate entity structure
Impact on data privacy and security. For e.g., whether access to customer data has to be
extended to staff of the service provider

•  Whether the bank has adequate flexibility to switch service providers, so that the risk of
being  attached  to  a  single  service  provider  is  adequately  mitigated,  and  the  aggregate
exposure to a single service provider

Banks  should  undertake  a  periodic  review  of  their  outsourced  processes  to  identify  new
outsourcing  risks  as  they  arise.  For  e.g.  when  the  service  provider  has  further  sub-
contracted  work  to  other  service  providers  or  has  undergone  a  significant  change  in
processes, infrastructure, or management.

Materiality should be considered both at an institution level and on a consolidated basis i.e.
together with the institution’s branches and corporations/entities under its control.

2.  Risk Management in outsourcing arrangements

Risk  management  is  the  process  of  identifying,  measuring,  monitoring  and  managing  risk.
Risks  inherent  to  process  outsourcing,  include  Strategic  risk,  Reputation  risk,  Operational
risk,  Compliance  risk,  Legal  risk,  Counter  party  risk,  Country  risk,  Contractual  risk,  Access
risk, Concentration and systemic risk, and Exit strategy risk. Failure of a service provider in
providing  a  specified  service,  a  breach  in  security/  confidentiality,  or  non-compliance  with
legal and regulatory requirements, among others may lead to reputation / financial losses for
the  bank  and  may  also  result  in  systemic  risks  within  the  banking  system  in  the  country.
Pervasive use of technology in banking operations further amplifies the risk impact.

(i)  Risk Evaluation and Measurement

Risk  evaluation  should  be  performed  prior  to  entering  into  an  outsourcing  agreement  and
reviewed  periodically  in  the  light  of  known  and  expected  changes,  as  part  of  the  strategic
planning or review processes.

The framework for risk evaluation should include the following steps:

•

Identification  of  the  role  of  outsourcing  in  the  overall  business  strategy  and  objectives,
and inter-linkages with corporate strategic goals

•  Comprehensive due diligence on the nature, scope and complexity of the outsourcing to
identify  the  key  risks  and  risk  mitigation  strategies  For  e.g.  in  case  of  technology
outsourcing,  state  of security  practices  and controls  environment  offered  by  the  service
provider is a key factor

•  Analysis  of  the  impact  of  such  arrangement  on  the  overall  risk  profile  of  the  bank,  and
whether adequate internal expertise and resources exist to mitigate the risks identified
•  Analysis of risk-return on the potential benefits of outsourcing vis-à-vis the vulnerabilities

that may arise

P a g e  | 77

Banks should evaluate vendor managed processes or specific vendor relationships as they
relate  to  information  systems  and  technology.  All  outsourced  information  systems  and
operations may be subject to risk management and security and privacy policies that meet
the Bank’s own standards.

(ii) Service provider selection

Management  should  identify  functions  to  be  outsourced  along  with  necessary  controls  and
solicit  responses  from  prospective  bidders  via  an  RFP  process.  Proposals  submitted  by
service  providers  should  be  evaluated  in  the  light  of  the  organisation’s  needs,  and  any
differences  in  the  service  provider  proposals  as  compared  to  the  solicitation  should  be
analyzed  carefully.  Selection  of  affiliated  parties  as  service  providers  should  be  done  at
arm’s length in accordance with this guideline.

Due Diligence

In negotiating / renewing an Outsourcing arrangement, due diligence should be performed to
assess  the  capability  of  the  technology  service  provider  to  comply  with  obligations  in  the
outsourcing agreement. Due diligence should involve an evaluation of all information about
the service provider including qualitative, quantitative, financial, operational and reputational
factors, as follows:

•  Past experience and competence to implement and support proposed activities over the

contractual period

•  Financial soundness and ability to service commitments even under adverse conditions
•  Business  reputation  and  culture,  compliance,  complaints  and  outstanding  or  potential

litigations

•  Security  and  internal  control,  audit  coverage  reporting  and  monitoring  environment,

business continuity management

•  External  factors  like  political,  economic,  social  and  legal  environment  of  jurisdiction  in
which  the  service  provider  operates  and  other  events  that  may  impact  service
performance

•  Business continuity arrangements in case of technology outsourcing
•  Due diligence for sub-service providers
•  Risk management, framework, alignment to applicable international standards on quality

/ security / environment, etc., may be considered

•  Secure infrastructure facilities
•  Employee training, knowledge transfer
•  Reliance on and ability to deal with sub-contractors
Extent  of  due  diligence  reviews  may  vary  based  on  risk  inherent  in  the  outsourcing
the  selection  process  should  be
arrangements.  Due  diligence  undertaken  during
documented and re-performed periodically as part of the monitoring and control processes of
outsourcing.

Maintaining Caution lists and scoring for service providers (bureau services)

Where  possible  the  bank  may  obtain  independent  reviews  and  market  feedback  to
supplement internal findings. Banks should ensure that information used for due diligence is
current and not more than 12 months old.

Reporting to the regulator

Banks must be required to report to the regulator, where the scale and nature of functions
outsourced are significant, or extensive data sharing is involved across geographic locations

P a g e  | 78

as  part  of  technology  /  process  outsourcing  and  when  data  pertaining  to  Indian  operations
are stored/processed abroad.

Multiple Service provider relationships

A  multiple  service  provider  relationship  is  one  where  two  or  more  service  providers
collaborate to deliver an end to end solution to the financial institution. Multiple contracting
scenarios are possible:

•  One service provider may be designated as the ‘Lead Service Provider’, to manage the

other service providers

•  Bank may independently enter into stand-alone contracts with each service provider

An institution selects from the above or any other contractual relationship, however, remains
responsible for understanding and monitoring the control environment of all service providers
that have access to the banks systems, records or resources.

(iii)  Contracting

The terms and conditions governing the contract between the bank and the service provider
should be carefully defined in written agreements and vetted by bank's legal counsel on their
legal effect and enforceability.

Banks  should  ensure  that  the  contract  brings  out  nature  of  legal  relationship  between  the
parties  (agent,  principal  or  otherwise),  and  addresses  risks  and  mitigation  strategies
identified at the risk evaluation and due diligence stages. Contracts should clearly define the
roles  and  responsibilities  of  the  parties  to  the  contract  and  include  suitable  indemnification
clauses. Any ‘limitation of liability’ consideration incorporated by the service provider should
be assessed in consultation with the legal department.

Contracts should provide for periodic renewal and re-negotiation to enable the institution to
retain  an  appropriate  level  of  control  over  the  outsourcing  and  should  include  the  right  to
intervene with appropriate measure to meet the Banks’ legal and regulatory obligations.

Contractual agreements should, in the very least, have provisions for the following:

•  Scope: Agreements should state the activities that are to be outsourced
•  Performance Standards: Key performance metrics should be defined for each activity to

be outsourced, as part of the overall Service Level Agreement

•  Monitoring  and  Oversight:  Provide  for  continuous  monitoring  and  assessment  by  the
bank  of  the  service  provider  so  that  any  necessary  corrective  measure  can  be  taken
immediately

•  Access to books and records / Audit and Inspection: This would include :
(cid:57)  Ensure that the bank has the ability to access all books, records and information relevant
to the outsourced activity available with the service provider. For technology outsourcing,
requisite  audit  trails  and  logs  for  administrative  activities  should  be  retained  and
accessible to the Bank based on approved requests

(cid:57)  Provide the bank with the right to conduct audits on the service provider whether by its
internal or external auditors, or by external specialists appointed to act on its behalf and
to obtain copies of any audit or review reports and findings made on the service provider
in conjunction with the services performed for the bank
Include clauses to allow the Reserve Bank of India or persons authorized by it to access
the bank’s documents, records of transactions, and other necessary information given to,
stored  or  processed  by  the  service  provider  within  a  reasonable  time.  This  includes
information maintained in paper and electronic formats

(cid:57)

P a g e  | 79

(cid:57)  Recognize the right of the Reserve Bank to cause an inspection to be made of a service
provider of a bank and its books and account by one or more of its officers or employees
or other persons

(cid:57)  Where  the  controlling/Head  offices  of  foreign  banks  operating  in  India  outsource  the
activities related to the Indian operations, the Agreement should include clauses to allow
the  RBI  or  persons  authorized  by  it  to  access  the  bank's  documents,  records  of
transactions and other necessary information given or stored or processed by the service
provider within a reasonable time as also clauses to recognize the right of RBI to cause
an  inspection  to  be  made  of  a  service  provider  and  its  books  and  accounts  by  one  or
more of its officers or employees or other persons

•

Include termination clause :

(cid:57)  Contracts  should  include  a  termination  clause  and  minimum  periods  to  execute  a

termination provision, as deemed necessary

(cid:57)  Agreements  should  provide  for  maintaining  confidentiality  of  customer's  information

even after the contract expires or is terminated by either party

(cid:57)  Contract  should  include  conditions  for  default  termination  /  early  exit  option  for
contracts.  This  may  include  circumstances  when  the  service  provider  undergoes  a
change in ownership, becomes insolvent or goes under liquidation, received judicial
indictment  (whether  within  India  or  any  other  location),  or  when  there  has  been  a
breach of confidentiality, security, or demonstrable deterioration in quality of services
rendered
In all cases of termination (early or otherwise), an appropriate handover process for
data and process needs to be agreed with the service provider

(cid:57)

•  Confidentiality and security :

(cid:57)  Mandate controls to ensure customer data confidentiality and service providers' liability in
case of breach of security and leakage of confidential customer related information. For
e.g.  use  of  transaction-enabled  mobile  banking  channels  necessitates  encryption
controls to ensure security of data in transmission

(cid:57)  Provide  for  the  preservation  of  documents  and  data  by  the  service  provider  in

accordance with the legal/regulatory obligation of the bank in this regard

•  Business  Continuity:  The  contract  should  contain  clauses  for  contingency  plans  and

testing thereof, to maintain business continuity.

•  Sub-contracting:  Agreements  may  include  covenants  limiting  further  sub-contracting.
Agreements  should  provide  for  due  prior  approval/consent  by  the  bank  of  the  use  of
subcontractors by the service provider for all or part of an outsourced activity. The bank
should retain the ability of similar control and oversight over the sub service provider as
the service provider.

•  Dispute  resolution:  Agreements  should  specify  the  resolution  process,  the  event  of
default, indemnities involved and the remedies and recourse of the respective parties to
the agreement.

•  Applicable  laws:  Agreements  should  include  choice  of  law  provisions,  based  on  the
regulations  as  applicable  to  the  bank.  An  agreement  should  be  tailored  to  provide  for
specific  risks  relating  to  cross  border  businesses  and  operations,  data  privacy  and
ownership aspects, among others.

P a g e  | 80

(iv)  Monitoring and Control of outsourced activities

Banks should establish a structure for management and control of outsourcing, based on the
nature, scope, complexity and inherent risk of the outsourced activity.

A  structure  for  monitoring  and  control  of  outsourced  activities  should  comprise  of  the
following:

•  A  central  record  of  all  material  outsourcing,  including  technology  outsourcing  and  sub
service  provider  relationships,  that  is  readily  accessible  for  review  by  the  Board  and
senior  management  of  the  bank  should  be  maintained.  The  records  should  be  updated
promptly and half yearly reviews should be placed before the Board.

•  Banks should at least on an annual basis, review the financial and operational condition
of the service provider to assess its ability to continue to meet its outsourcing obligations.
Such  due  diligence  reviews,  which  can  be  based  on  all  available  information  about  the
service  provider  should  highlight  any  deterioration  or  breach  in  performance  standards,
confidentiality and security, and in business continuity preparedness.

•  Banks  should  review  and  monitor  the  security  practices  and  control  processes  of  the
service provider on a regular basis and require the service provider to disclose security
breaches.

•  Banks  should  pro-actively  intimate  RBI  of  any  adverse  developments  or  non  –

•

compliance with legal and regulatory requirements in an outsourcing arrangement.
In the event of outsourcing of technology operations, the banks should subject the same
to  enhanced  and  rigorous  change  management  and  monitoring  controls  since  ultimate
responsibility and accountability rests with the bank. It may be desirable if banks control
the  management  of  user  ids  created  for  use  of  external  vendor  personnel.  As  a
contingency  measure,  banks  may  also  endeavor  to  develop,  over  a  period  of  time,
reasonable  level  of  skills/knowledge  in  various  technology  related  areas  like  system
administration, database administration, network architecture and administration, etc., to
effectively engage with the vendors and also to take over these functions in the event of
any contingency.

Service Level Agreements and performance metrics

Management  should  include  SLAs  in  the  outsourcing  contracts  to  agree  and  establish
accountability  for  performance  expectations.  SLAs  must  clearly  formalize  the  performance
criteria  to  measure  the  quality  and  quantity  of  service  levels.  Banks  should  develop  the
following towards establishing an effective oversight program:

•  Formal policy that defines the SLA program
•  SLA monitoring process
•  Recourse in case of non-performance
•  Escalation process
•  Dispute resolution process
•  Conditions in which the contract may be terminated by either party
For  outsourced  technology  operations,  specific  metrics  may  be  defined  around  the  service
availability,  business  continuity  and  transaction  security,  in  order  to  measure  services
rendered by the external vendor organization. Please refer to the chapter on ‘IT Operations’
for details on the SLA and performance metrics for technology operations.

Performance  expectations,  under  both  normal  and  contingency  circumstances,  need  to  be
defined. Provisions need to be in place for timely and orderly intervention and rectification in
the event of substandard performance by the service provider.

P a g e  | 81

Control environment offered by the Service Provider

Banks should evaluate the adequacy of internal controls environment offered by the service
provider.  Due  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  implementation  of  following  by  the
service provider:

Information security policies and employee awareness of the same

•
•  Controls  for  logical  access  to  customer  information  by  service  provider  staff,  so  that

information may be accessed on a need-to-know basis only

•  Physical and environmental security and controls
•  Network security and controls
•  Formal process for tracking and monitoring program changes and projects
•  Process for incident reporting and problem management
•  Special  control  considerations  for  service  providers  using  cloud  computing  as  part  of

service

•  Control  considerations  for  handling  of  customer  information  and  personally  identifiable

information

•  Data classification and controls for handling data

Periodic Risk Assessment, Audit and Reviews

Outsourcing  should  not  impede  or  interfere  with  the  ability  of  the  Bank  or  the  Regulator  in
performing its supervisory functions and objectives.

As a practice, institutions should conduct pre- and post- outsourcing implementation reviews.
An institution should also review its outsourcing arrangements periodically to ensure that its
outsourcing risk management policies and procedures, and these Guidelines, are effectively
complied with.

An  institution  should,  at  least  on  an  annual  basis,  review  the  financial  and  operational
condition  of  the  service  provider  to  assess  its  ability  to  continue  to  meet  outsourcing
obligations.  Such  due  diligence  reviews,  which  can  be  based  on  all  available  information
about  the  service  provider  including  reports  by  the  service  provider’s  external  auditors,
should  highlight  any  deterioration  or  breach  in  performance  standards,  confidentiality  and
security, and in business continuity preparedness.

Banks  should  also  periodically  commission  independent  audit  and  expert  assessments  on
the security and control environment of the service provider. Such assessments and reports
on  the  service  provider  may  be  performed  and  prepared  by  the  institution’s  internal  or
external auditors, or by agents appointed by the institution.

Such reviews should take adequate cognizance of historical violations or issue remediation
during previous audits and assessments. Copies of previous audits and assessments should
be shared during RBI inspections.

Business Continuity Planning

Banks  should  ensure  that  their  business  continuity  preparedness  is  not  adversely
compromised  on  account  of  outsourcing.  Banks  are  expected  to  adopt  sound  business
continuity  management  practices  as  issued  by  RBI  and  seek  proactive  assurance  that  the
outsourced  service  provider  maintains  readiness  and  preparedness  for  business  continuity
on an ongoing basis.

Banks,  while  framing  the  viable  contingency  plan,  need  to  consider  the  availability  of
alternative  service  providers  or  the  possibility  of  bringing  the  outsourced  activity  back-in-
house  in  an  emergency(for  example,  where  number  of  vendors  for  a  particular  service  is

P a g e  | 82

extremely  limited)  and  the  costs,  time  and  resources  that  would  be  involved  and  take
suitable preparatory action.

(v) Confidentiality and Security

Public confidence is a cornerstone in the stability and reputability of a bank. Banks should be
proactive  to  identify  and  specify  the  minimum  security  baselines  to  be  adhered  to  by  the
service providers to ensure confidentiality and security of data. This is particularly applicable
where  third  party  service  providers  have  access  to  personally  identifiable  information  and
critical customer data.

An institution may take the following steps to ensure that risks with respect to confidentiality
and security of data are adequately mitigated:

•  Address,  agree  and  document  specific  responsibilities  of  the  respective  parties  in
outsourcing  to  ensure  adequacy  and  effectiveness  of  security  practices,  including
identifying obligations and liability in the event of a breach or default

•  Discuss  and  agree  on  the  instances  where  customer  data  shall  be  accessed  and  the
user groups who will have access to the same. Access to a Bank’s data should be strictly
on a need to know basis

•  Ensure  that  service  provider  employees  are  adequately  aware  and  informed  on  the

security and privacy policies

(vi) Outsourcing to Foreign Service providers

The engagement of service providers across multiple geographies exposes the organization
to  country  risk  –  economic,  social  and  political  reasons  in  the  country  that  may  adversely
affect  the  Banks  business  and  operations.  Banks  should  proactively  evaluate  such  risk  as
part  of  the  due  diligence  process  and  develop  appropriate  mitigating  controls  and  as
required, an effective exit strategy.

Outsourcing outside India should be agreed, in a manner that does not obstruct or hinder the
ability  of  the  bank  or  regulatory  authorities  to  perform  periodic  audits/inspections  and
assessments,  supervise  or  reconstruct  activities  of  the  bank  based  on  books,  records  and
necessary documentation, in a timely manner. Banks should ensure the following:

•  Banks  should  principally  enter  into  arrangements  with  parties  operating  in  jurisdictions

that generally uphold confidentiality clauses and agreements

•  Banks  may  not  outsource  within  jurisdictions  where  access  to  books,  records  and  any
other  information  required  for  audit  and  review  purposes  may  be  impeded  due  to
regulatory or administrative constraints

•  Banks  should  notify  the Regulator  where  the  rights  of  access  for  the  Bank  and  /  or the

Regulator are likely to be impeded

•  Emerging  technologies  such  as  data  center  hosting,  applications  as  a  service,  cloud
computing  have  given  rise  to  unique  legal  jurisdictions  for  data  and  cross  border
regulations. Banks should clarify the jurisdiction for their data and applicable regulations
at  the  outset  of  an  outsourcing  arrangement.  This  information  should  be  reviewed
periodically and in case of significant changes performed by the service provider

(vii)  Outsourcing within a Group

P a g e  | 83

These  guidelines  are  generally  applicable  to  outsourcing  within  a  group  conglomerate,
including  parent  or  Head  Office,  branch  or  a  group  company,  whether  located  within  or
outside India. These requirements may be addressed as part of group wide risk assessment
and management procedures.

Due diligence on an intra-group service provider may take the form of evaluating qualitative
aspects  on  the  ability  of  the  service  provider  to  address  risks  specific  to  the  institution,
particularly  those  relating  to  business  continuity  management,  monitoring  and  control,  and
audit and inspection, including confirmation on the right of access to be provided to RBI to
retain  effective  supervision  over  the  institution,  and  compliance  with  local  regulatory
standards.  The  respective  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  office  in  the  outsourcing
arrangement should be documented in writing in a formal Service Level Agreement.

(viii)  Handling customer grievances and complaints

The Board and senior management are responsible for ensuring that quality and availability
of  banking  services  to  customers  are  not  adversely  affected  due  to  the  outsourcing
arrangements entered into by the Bank. Banks need to institute a robust grievance redressal
mechanism, which should not be compromised in any way due to outsourcing.

The name and contact number of designated grievance redressal officer of the bank should
be  made  known  and  widely  publicized.  The  designated  officer  should  ensure  that  genuine
grievances of customers are redressed promptly without involving delay. It should be clearly
indicated that banks' Grievance Redressal Machinery will also deal with the issue relating to
services provided by the outsourced agency.

Generally,  a  time  limit  of  30  days  may  be  given  to  the  customers  for  forwarding  their
complaints / grievances. The grievance redressal procedure of the bank and the time frame
fixed  for  responding  to  the  complaints  should  be  placed  on  the  bank's  website.  If  a
complainant does not get satisfactory response from the bank within 60 days from the date
of his lodging the complaint, he will have the option to approach the Office of the concerned
Banking Ombudsman for redressal of his grievance/s.

CHAPTER 5: IS AUDIT

Introduction:
In the past decade, with the increased technology adoption by Banks, the complexities within
the  IT  environment  have  given  rise  to  considerable  technology  related  risks  requiring
effective management.

This led the Banks to implement an Internal Control framework, based on various standards
and  its  own  control  requirements  and  the  current  RBI  guidelines.  As  a  result,  Bank’s
management  and  RBI,  need  an  assurance  on  the  effectiveness  of  internal  controls
implemented  and  expect  the  IS Audit  to  provide  an  independent  and  objective  view  of  the
extent to which the risks are managed.

As  a  consequence,  the  nature  of  the  Internal  Audit  department  has  undergone  a  major
transformation  and  IS  audits  are  gaining  importance  as  key  processes  are  automated,  or
enabled by technology. Hence, there is a need for banks to re-assess the IS Audit processes
and ensure that IS Audit objectives are effectively met.

The scope of IS Audit includes:

•  Determining effectiveness of planning and oversight of IT activities
•  Evaluating adequacy of operating processes and internal controls
•  Determining  adequacy  of  enterprise-wide  compliance  efforts,  related  to  IT  policies

•

and internal control procedures
Identifying  areas  with  deficient  internal  controls,  recommend  corrective  action  to
address  deficiencies  and  follow-up,  to  ensure  that  the  management  effectively
implements the required actions

Following areas have been covered under this chapter:

•

IS  Audit:  The  organisation's  structure,  roles  and  responsibilities.  The  chapter
identifies  the  IS  Audit  stakeholders,  defines  their  roles,  responsibilities  and
competencies required to adequately support the IS Audit function

•  Audit Charter or Policy (to be included in the IS Audit): This point addresses the need

to include IS Audit as a part of the Audit Charter or Policy

•  Planning an IS Audit: This point addresses planning for an IS Audit, using Risk Based
Audit  Approach.  It  begins  with  an  understanding  of  IT  risk  assessment  concepts,
methodology  and  defines  the  IS  Audit  Universe,  scoping  and  planning  an  audit
execution

•  Executing an IS Audit: This describes steps for executing the audit, covering activities
such as understanding the business process and IT environment, refining the scope
and  identifying  internal  controls,  testing  for  control  design  and  control  objectives,
appropriate  audit  evidence,  documentation  of  work  papers  and  conclusions  of  tests
performed

•  Reporting  and  Follow-up:  Describes  the  audit  summary  and  memorandum,  the
requirements for discussing findings with the management, finalising and submitting
reports,  carrying  out  follow-up  procedures,  archiving  documents  and  ensuring
continuous auditing

•  Quality  Review:  This  addresses  the  quality  aspects  which  ensures  supervision  and

exercising due care.

1)  Role and Responsibilities / Organisational structure

Board of Directors and Senior Management
Board of Directors and senior management are responsible for ensuring that an institution’s
system  of  internal  controls  operates  effectively.  One  important  element  of  an  effective

P a g e  | 85

internal  control  system  is  an  internal  audit  function  that  includes  adequate  IT  coverage. To
meet its responsibility of providing an independent audit function with sufficient resources to
ensure adequate IT coverage, the Board, or its Audit Committee, should enable an internal
audit function, capable of evaluating IT controls adequately.

Audit Committee of the Board
An  institution’s  board  of  directors  establishes  an  “Audit  Committee”  to  oversee  audit
functions and to report on audit matters periodically to the Board of Directors. Banks should
enable adequately skilled Audit Committee composition to manage the complexity of the IS
Audit oversight.

A designated member of an Audit Committee needs to possess the knowledge of Information
Systems,  related  controls  and  audit  issues.  Designated  member  should  also  have
competencies  to  understand  the  ultimate  impact  of  deficiencies  identified  in  IT  internal
control framework by the IS Audit. The committee should devote appropriate time to IS audit
findings  identified  during  IS  Audits  and  members  of  the  Audit  Committee  need  to  review
critical issues highlighted and provide appropriate guidance to a bank’s management.

As a part of its overall responsibilities, the committee should also be ultimately responsible
for the following IS Audit areas:

•  Bank's  compliance  with  legal  and  regulatory  requirements  such  as  (among  others)
Information  Technology  Act-2000,  Information  Technology  (Amendment)  Act-2008,
Banker's  Books  (Evidence)  Act-1891,  The  Banking  Regulation  Act-1949,  Reserve
Bank of India Act-1934 and RBI circulars and guidelines

•  Appointment of the IS Audit Head
•  Performance of IS Audit
•  Evaluation of significant IS Audit issues

(A  Board  or  its  Audit  Committee  members  should  seek  training  to  fill  any  gaps  in  the
knowledge, related to IT risks and controls.)

Internal Audit/Information System Audit function
Internal  Audit  is  a  part  of  the  Board’s  assurance  process  with  regard  to  the  integrity  and
effectiveness of systems and controls. It is an independent group that reports directly to the
Audit Committee or the Board of Directors. IS Audit, being an integral part of Internal Audit,
requires  an  organisation  structure  with  well-defined  roles  which  needs  to  function  in
alignment with the Internal Audit, and provide technical audit support on key focus areas of
audit  or  its  universe,  identified  by  an  Internal  Audit  department.  A  well-defined  IS  Audit
organisation structure ensures that the tasks performed fulfill a bank’s overall audit objective,
while preserving its independence, objectivity and competence.

In this regard, banks require a separate IS Audit function within an Internal Audit department
led  by  an  IS  Audit  Head  reporting  to  the  Head  of  Internal  Audit  or  Chief  Audit  Executive
(CAE). The personnel needs to assume overall responsibility and accountability of IS Audit
functions.  Where  the  bank  leverages  external  resources  for  conducting  IS Audit  on  areas
where skills are lacking, the responsibility and accountability for such external IS Audits still
remain with the IS Audit Head and CAE.

Critical Components and Processes

(i)  Because  the  IS  Audit  is  an  integral  part  of  the  Internal  Auditors,  auditors  will  also  be

required to be independent, competent and exercise due professional care.

Independence: IS Auditors should act independently of the bank's management. In matters

P a g e  | 86

related to the audit, the IS Audit should be independent of the auditee, both in attitude and
appearance.  The  Audit  Charter  or  Policy,  or  engagement  letter  (in  case  of  external
professional service provider), should address independence and accountability of the audit
function. In case independence is impaired (in fact or appearance), details of the impairment
should  be  disclosed  to  the  Audit  Committee  or  Board.  Independence  should  be  regularly
assessed  by  the  Audit  Committee.  In  case  of  rotation  of  audit  staff  members  from  IT
department  to  the  IS  Audit,  care  should  be  taken  to  ensure  that  the  past  role  of  such
individuals do not impact their independence and objectivity as an IS Auditor.
Additionally, to ensure independence for the IS Auditors, Banks should make sure that:

•  Auditors have access to information and applications
•  Auditors have the right to conduct independent data inspection and analysis

Competence:  IS  Auditors  should  be  professionally  competent,  having  skills,  knowledge,
training and relevant experience. They should be appropriately qualified, have professional
certifications  and  maintain  professional  competence  through  professional  education  and
training. As IT encompasses a wide range of technologies, IS Auditors should possess skills
that are commensurate with the technology used by a bank. They should be competent audit
professionals with sufficient and relevant experience. Qualifications such as CISA (offered by
ISACA), DISA (offered by ICAI), or CISSP (offered by ISC2), along with two or more years of
IS Audit experience, are desirable. Similar qualification criteria should also be insisted upon,
in case of outsourced professional service providers.

Due Professional Care: IS Auditors should exercise due professional care, which includes
following  the  professional  auditing  standards  in  conducting  the  audit.  The  IS  Audit  Head
should deal with any concerns in applying them during the audit. IS Auditors should maintain
the  highest  degree  of  integrity  and  conduct. They  should  not  adopt  methods  that  could  be
seen as unlawful, unethical or unprofessional to obtain or execute an audit.

(ii) Outsourcing relating to IS Audit
Banks may decide to outsource execution of segments of audit plan to external professional
service providers, as per the overall audit strategy decided in co-ordination with the CAE and
the Audit Committee. This may be due to inadequate staff available internally within the bank
to  conduct  audits,  or  insufficient  levels  of  skilled  staff.  The  work  outsourced  shall  be
restricted to execution of audits identified in the plan. Banks need to ensure that the overall
ownership  and  responsibility  of  the  IS  Audit,  including  the  audit  planning  process,  risk
assessment and follow-up of compliance remains within the bank. External assistance may
be obtained initially to put in place necessary processes in this regard.

Both  the  CAE  and  Audit  Committee  should  ensure  that  the  external  professional  service
providers appointed should be competent in the area of work that is outsourced and should
have relevant prior experience in that area.

2)  Audit Charter, Audit Policy to include IS Audit

Audit Charter or Policy is a document, which guides and directs activities of an internal audit
function.  IS  Audit,  being  integral  part  of  an  Internal  Audit  department,  should  also  be
governed  by  the  same  charter  or  policy.  The  charter  should  be  documented  to  contain  a
clear  description  of  its  mandate,  purpose,  responsibility,  authority  and  accountability  of
relevant members or officials in respect of the IS Audit (namely the IS Auditors, management
and  Audit  Committee)  apart  from  the  operating  principles.  The  IS  Auditor  will  have  to
determine  how  to  achieve  the  implementation  of  the  applicable  IS  Audit  standards,  use
professional  judgment  in  their  application,  and  be  prepared  to  justify  any  departure
therefrom.

(a)  Contents of the Audit Policy

The  policy  should  also  cover  Audit  Rating  Methodology  and  Quality  Assurance  Reviews.
There  should  also  be  annual  review  of  IS  Audit  Policy  or  Charter  to  ensure  continued
relevance.

(b)  Communication with the Auditees

Effective communication with the auditees involves considering the following:

•  Describing a service, its scope, availability and timeliness of delivery
•  Providing cost estimates or budgets, if needed
•  Describing problems and possible resolutions

P a g e  | 88

•  Providing adequate and accessible facilities for effective communication
•  Determining relationship between the service offered, and the needs of the auditee

The  Audit  Charter  forms  a  basis  for  communication  with  an  auditee.  It  should  include
relevant references to service-level agreements for aspects like the following, as applicable:

−  Availability for Unplanned Work
−  Delivery of reports
−  Costs
−  Response to Auditee’s Complaints
−  Quality of Service
−  Review of Performance
−  Communication with the Auditee
−  Needs Assessment
−  Control Risk Self-assessment
−  Agreement of Terms of Reference for Audit
−  Reporting Process
−  Agreement of Findings

(c)  Quality Assurance Process

The  IS Auditor  should  consider  establishing  a  quality  assurance  process  (e.g.,  interviews,
customer  satisfaction  surveys,  or  assignment  performance  surveys)  to  understand  his
expectations relevant to the function. These needs should be evaluated against the Charter,
to improve the service or change the service delivery or Audit Charter, if necessary.

(d)  Engagement Letter

Engagement  letters  are  often  used for  individual  assignments. They  set  out  the  scope  and
objectives  of  a  relationship  between  an  external  IS  audit  agency  and  an  organisation. The
letter should address the three aspects of responsibility, authority and accountability.

Following aspects needs to  be considered:
Responsibility:  The  aspects  addressed  includes  scope,  objectives,  independence,  risk
assessment, specific auditee requirements and deliverables
Authority:  The  aspects  to  be  addressed  include  right  of  access  to  information,  personnel,
locations  and  systems  relevant  to  the  performance  of  the  assignment,  scope  or  any
limitations of scope and documentary evidence or information of agreement to the terms and
conditions of the engagement
Accountability:  Areas  addressed  include  designated  or  intended  recipients  of  reports,
auditees’  rights,  quality  reviews,  agreed  completion  dates  and  agreed  budgets  or  fees  if
available

3)  Planning an IS Audit

(a)  Introduction

An effective IS Audit programme addresses IT risk exposures throughout a bank, including
areas  of  IT  management  and  strategic  planning,  data  centre  operations,  client  or  server
architecture,  local  and  wide-area  networks,  telecommunications,  physical  and  information
security, electronic banking, applications used in banking operations, systems development,
and business continuity planning.

A  well-planned,  properly  structured  audit  programme
to  evaluate  risk
management practices, internal control systems and compliance with policies concerning IT-
related risks of every size and complexity. Effective programmes are risk-focused, promote
sound  IT  controls,  ensure  timely  resolution  of  audit  deficiencies,  and  inform  the  Audit
Committee of the effectiveness of Risk Management practices and internal control systems.

is  essential

P a g e  | 89

In  the  past,  the  Internal Audit  concentrated  on  transaction  testing,  testing  of  accuracy  and
reliability  of  accounting  records  and  financial  reports,  integrity,  reliability  and  timeliness  of
control reports, and adherence to legal and regulatory requirements.

However,  in  the  changing  scenario,  there  is  an  increased  need  for  widening,  as  well  as
redirecting,  the  scope  of  Internal  Audit  to  evaluate  the  adequacy  of  IT  Risk  Management
procedures and internal control systems. To achieve these, banks are moving towards risk-
based internal audit, which include, in addition to selective transaction testing, an evaluation
of the Risk Management systems and control procedures prevailing in a bank’s operations.

Risk-based Internal Audit (RBIA) approach helps in planning the IS Audit.
It includes the following components:
•  Understanding IT Risk Assessment Concepts
•  Adopting a suitable IT Risk Assessment Methodology–used to examine auditable units in
the  IS  audit  universe  and  select  areas  for  review  to  include  in  the  IS Annual  Plan  that
have the greatest risk exposure

Steps involved are:
•  Step 1: System Characterisation
•  Step 2: Threat Identification
•  Step 3: Vulnerability Identification
•  Step 4: Control Analysis
•  Step 5: Likelihood Determination
•  Step 6: Impact Analysis
•  Step 7: Risk Determination

As a part of RBIA, planning the IS Audit involves the following:

•  Defining  the  IS Audit  Universe:  This  covers  the  IS Audit  Universe,  which  defines

the areas to be covered

•  Scoping for IS Audit: This addresses the scoping requirements and includes:

(cid:131)  Defining control objectives and activities
(cid:131)  Considering materiality
(cid:131)  Building a fraud risk perspective

•  Planning  Execution  of  an  Audit:  This  describes  the  steps  of  a  planning  process

before IS Audit starts execution of the plan

(cid:131)  Documenting an audit plan
(cid:131)  Nature and extent of test of control
(cid:131)  Sampling techniques
(cid:131)  Standards and frameworks
(cid:131)  Resource management

The above components are clarified in the sub-sections below:

(b) Risk Based IS Audit

This internal audit approach is aimed at developing a risk-based audit plan keeping in mind
th  inherent  risks  of  a  business  or  location  and  effectiveness  of  control  systems  managing
inherent risks. In this approach, every bank business or location, including risk management
function, undergoes a risk assessment by the internal audit function.

RBI  issued  the  “Guidance  Note  on  Risk-based  Internal  Audit”  in  2002  to  all  scheduled
commercial banks, introducing the system of “risk-based internal audit”.

The guidance note at a broad-level provided the following aspects:

•  Development of a well-defined policy for risk-based internal audit

P a g e  | 90

•  Adoption of a risk assessment methodology for formulating risk based audit plan
•  Development  of  risk  profile  and  drawing  up  of  risk  matrix  taking  inherent  business

risk and effectiveness of the control system for monitoring the risk

•  Preparation of annual audit plan, covering risks and prioritization, based on level and

direction of each risk

•  Setting  up  of  communication  channels  between  audit  staff  and  management,  for

reporting issues that pose a threat to a bank’s business

•  Periodic evaluation of the risk assessment methodology
•

Identification  of  appropriate  personnel  to  undertake  risk-based  audit,  and  imparting
them with relevant training

•  Addressing transitional and change management issues

The overall plan, arrived at, using the risk assessment approach enables the Internal Audit to
identify and examine key business areas that have highest exposure and enables effective
allocation of Audit resources.  As stated earlier, IS Audit, being an integral part of the Internal
Audit, there is a need for IS Auditors to focus on the IT risks, related to the high-risk business
areas  identified  by  the  Internal Audit  for  review  during  a  year. This  enables  the  IS Audit  to
provide  an  assurance  to  the  management  on  the  effectiveness  of  risk  management  and
internal  controls  underlying  the  high-risk  business  processes,  which  when  read  in
conjunction with the Internal Audit reports, provides a holistic view of the effectiveness.

Risk-based IS Audit needs to consider the following:

(cid:131)

(cid:131)

Identification of an institution’s data, application, technology, facilities,
and personnel
Identification of business activities and processes within each of those
categories

(cid:131)  Profiles  of  significant  business  units,  departments  and  product  lines
and systems, and their associated business risks and control features,
resulting  in  a  document  describing  the  structure  of  risk  and  controls
throughout the institution

(cid:131)

(cid:131)  Use  a  measurement  or  scoring  system  that  ranks  and  evaluates
business  and  control  risks  for  business  units,  departments  and
products
Includes Board or Audit Committee approval of risk assessments and
annual Risk-based Audit Plans that establish audit schedules, cycles,
work programme scope and resource allocation for each area audited
Implementation of the Audit Plan

(cid:131)

Further,  while  identifying  IT  risks,  an  IS Auditor  must  consider  the  impact  of  non-alignment
with any information security-related guidelines issued by RBI based on recommendations in
Chapter 2 of this report. It should also be ensured that all systems, domains and processes,
irrespective of their risk-levels, are covered within a period of three years.

(c)  Adopting a Suitable Risk Assessment Methodology

The IS Auditor must define, adopt and follow a suitable risk assessment methodology. This
should  be  in  consonance  with  the  focus  on  risks,  to  be  addressed  as  a  part  of  the  overall
Internal Audit Strategy.
A  successful  risk-based  IS Audit  Programme  can  be  based  on  an  effective  scoring  system
arrived at by considering all relevant risk factors.

Major  risk  factors  used  in  scoring  systems  include:  Adequacy  of  internal  controls,
business criticality, regulatory requirements, amount or value of transactions processed, if a
key customer information is held, customer facing systems, financial loss potential, number

P a g e  | 91

of  transactions  processed,  availability  requirements,  experience  of  management  and  staff,
turnover,  technical  competence,  degree  of  delegation,  technical  and  process  complexity,
stability of application, age of system, training of users, number of interfaces, availability of
documentation, extent of dependence on the IT system, confidentiality requirements, major
changes carried out, previous audit observations and senior management oversight.

On the basis of risk matrix of business criticality and system or residual risk, applications or
systems  can  be  graded,  based  on  where  they  fall  on  the  “risk  map”  and  accordingly  their
audit frequency can be decided. Banks should develop written guidelines on the use of risk
assessment tools and risk factors and review these with the Audit Committee or the Board.
Risk  assessment  guidelines  will  vary  for  banks  depending  on  size,  complexity,  scope  of
activities,  geographic  diversity  and  technology  systems  used.  Auditors  should  use  the
guidelines to grade major risk areas and define range of scores or assessments
(e.g., groupings such as low, medium, or high risk or a numerical sequence such as 1 to 5).

The written risk assessment guidelines should specify the following elements:

•  Maximum  length  for  audit  cycles  based  on  the  risk  assessment  process:  For
example, very high to high risk applications audit cycle can be at a frequency ranging
from six months upto 12, medium risk applications can be 18 months (or below) and
up to 36 months for low-risk areas. Audit cycles should not be open-ended.

•  Timing  of  risk  assessments  for  each  business  area  or  department:  While  risk
assessment  is  expected  to  be  on  an  annual  basis,  frequent  assessments  may  be
needed if an institution experiences rapid growth or change in operation or activities.

•  Documentation  requirements

to  support  risk  assessment  and  scoring

decisions

•  Guidelines  for  overriding  risk  assessments

in  special  cases  and  the
circumstances  under  which  they  can  be  overridden:  Example:  due  to  major
changes  in  system,  additional  regulatory  or  legal  requirements,  a  medium  risk
application may have to be audited more frequently.

Notwithstanding the above, IT governance, information security governance-related aspects,
critical IT general controls such as data centre controls and processes and critical business
applications/systems having financial/compliance implications, including regulatory reporting,
risk  management,  customer  access  (delivery  channels)  and  MIS  systems,  needs  to  be
subjected  to  IS  Audit  at  least  once  a  year  (or  more  frequently,  if  warranted  by  the  risk
assessment).

IS  Auditors  should  periodically  review  results  of  internal  control  processes  and  analyse
financial  or  operational  data  for  any  impact  on  a  risk  assessment  or  scoring. Accordingly,
auditee  units  should  be  required  to  keep  auditors  up-to-date  on  major  changes,  such  as
introduction  of  a  new  product,  implementation  of  a  new  system,  application  conversions,
significant  changes  in  organisation  or  staff,  regulatory  and  legal  requirements,  security
incidents.

(d) Defining the IS Audit Universe

An Audit Universe is an outcome of the risk assessment process. It defines the audit areas
to be covered by the IS Auditor. It is usually a high-level structure that identifies processes,
resources,  risks  and  controls  related  to  IT,  allowing  for  a  risk-based  selection  of  the  audit
areas. The  IT  risks  faced  by  banks  due  to  emerging  technologies,  prioritisation  of  IS Audit
Universe,  selection  of  types  of  audits  that  need  to  be  performed,  optimisation  of  available
resources, and ensuring quality of findings, are challenges faced by IS Audit.

The  IS  Audit  Universe  can  be  built  around  the  four  types  of  IT  resources  and  processes:
Such  as  application  systems,  information  or  data,  infrastructure  (technology  and  facilities

P a g e  | 92

such  as  hardware,  operating  systems,  database  management  systems,  networking,
multimedia, and the environment that houses and supports them and enable processing of
applications)  and  people  (internal  or  outsourced  personnel  required  to  plan,  organise,
acquire,  implement,  deliver,  support,  monitor  and  evaluate  the  information  systems  and
services).

The challenge is to provide the “right level of granularity” in the definition of the universe, so
as to make it effective and efficient.
Though this is different for every bank, below are some of the considerations for defining IS
Audits:

•  Using  overly-broad  definitions  for  IS  Audits  (e.g.  IT  general  controls)  will
ensure a scope creep in audit procedures. The IS Audit Head should make sure
that  the  definition  of  each  IS  Audit  is  an  accurate  description  of  what  is  being
reviewed.

•

•  Audit  Universe  for  a  year  should  touch  upon  all  layers  in  the  IT  environment.
Though  each  IT  environment  is  different,  layers  tend  to  be  the  same.  If  an  IS Audit
plan does not include some review for each of the layers, odds are that the plan, as a
whole, is deficient.
IS  Audits  should  be  structured  in  such  a  way  as  to  provide  for  effective  and
logical reporting. For example: IS Audits of pervasive technologies (e.g. networks or
processes) are more effective when audited at an enterprise level.
IS Audits should address appropriate risks. In many cases, IS Audit budgets are
determined before the IT risk assessment is performed. This inevitably leads to one
of two situations:

•

An  inadequate  number  of  audit  hours  are  spread  over  too  many  audits,  which  results  in
consistently poor quality audits, because there is not enough time.
Audits that should be performed are not performed because the budget does not allow it.

(e)  Scoping for IS Audit

Information  gathered  by  the  IS  Auditors  during  IT  risk  assessment  about  the  IT  system
processing  and  operational  environment,  threats,  vulnerabilities,  impact  and  controls,
enables  identification  of  the  control  objectives  and  activities  to  be  tested  for  design  and
implementation effectiveness and its operating effectiveness.

Scoping plays a crucial role in overall effectiveness. This is exacerbated by the need for the
IS  Auditors  to  integrate  with  the  process,  operational  or  financial  auditors,  and  the
procedures  they  are  performing,  particularly  in  environments  with  large  integrated  CBS
applications, where a high number of key process controls are contained within the systems.
(An illustrative list of areas which can form a part of IS Audit scope are given in Annex-B.)

IS Audits  should  also  cover  branches,  with  focus  on  large  and  medium  branches,  in  areas
such  as  control  of  passwords,  user  ids,  operating  system  security,  anti-malware,  maker-
checker, segregation of duties, physical security, review of exception reports or audit trails,
BCP policy and or testing.

Reports and circulars issued by RBI for specific areas which also need to be covered in the
IS Audit Scope:

Report of the Committee on Computer Audit (dated: April 2, 2002)
Circular on Information System Audit–A Review of Policies and Practices
(dated: April 30, 2004 (RBI/2004/191 DBS.CO.OSMOS.BC/ 11 /33.01.029/2003-04)

(i)  Defining Control Objectives and Activities

IT control objectives, based on well known frameworks can be included in the scope.

P a g e  | 93

(ii)  Materiality

When  conducting  financial  statement  audits,  Internal  Auditors  measure  materiality  in
monetary terms, since areas that are audited are also measured and reported in monetary
terms. However, since IS Auditors conduct audit on non-financial items, alternative measures
are required to assess materiality. Such assessments are a matter of professional judgment.
They  include  consideration  of  its  effect  on  a  bank  as  a  whole,  of  errors,  omissions,
irregularities  and  illegal  acts,  which  may  have  happened  as  a  result  of  “internal  control
weaknesses” in an area being audited. ISACA IS Auditing Guideline G6: specifies that if the
IS Audit focus relates to systems or operations that process financial transactions, the value
of  assets  controlled  by  the  system(s),  or  the  value  of  transactions  processed  per
day/week/month/year, should be considered in assessing materiality. In case, the focus is on
systems  that  do  not  process  financial  transactions,  then  following  measures  should  be
considered:

•  Criticality of the business processes supported by the system or operation
•  Cost  of  system  or  operation  (hardware,  software,  staff,  third-party  services,

overheads or a combination of these)

•  Potential cost of errors (possibly in terms of irrecoverable development costs, cost of
publicity  required  for  warnings,  rectification  costs,  health  and  safety  costs,  high
wastage, etc.)

•  Number of accesses/transactions/inquiries processed per period
•  Nature, timing and extent of reports prepared, and files maintained
•  Service-level agreement requirements and cost of potential penalties
•  Penalties for failure to comply with legal and contractual requirements

IS Auditors  should  review  the  following  additional  areas  that  are  critical  and  high  risk  such
as:

(cid:131)

IT  Governance  and  information  security  governance  structures  and
practices implemented by the Bank

(cid:131)  Testing

the  controls  on  new  development  systems  before

implementing them in live environment.

(cid:131)  A pre-implementation review of application controls, including security
features  and  controls  over  change  management  process,  should  be
performed to confirm that:

•  Controls in existing application are not diluted, while migrating

data to the new application

•  Controls are designed and implemented to meet requirements
of a bank’s policies and procedures, apart from regulatory and
legal requirements

•  Functionality  offered  by  the  application  is  used  to  meet

appropriate control objectives

(cid:131)  A post implementation review of application controls should be carried
out  to  confirm  if  the  controls  as  designed  are  implemented,  and  are
operating, effectively. Periodic review of application controls should be
a part of an IS audit scope, in order to detect the impact of application
changes on controls. This should be coupled with review of underlying
environment–operating  system,  database,  middleware,  etc.–as
weaknesses
the
effectiveness  of  controls  at  the  application  layer.  Due  care  should  be
taken  to  ensure  that  IS  Auditors  have  access  only  to  the  test
environment  for  performing  the  procedures  and  data  used  for  testing
should be, as far as practical, be a replica of live environment.

the  underlying  environment  can  negate

(cid:131)

(cid:131)  Detailed  audit  of  SDLC  process  to  confirm  that  security  features  are
incorporated into a new system, or while modifying an existing system,
should be carried out.
 A review of processes followed by an implementation team to ensure
data integrity after implementation of a new application or system, and
a  review  of  data  migration  from  legacy  systems  to  the  new  system
where applicable, should be followed.
IS Auditors may validate IT risks (identified by business teams) before
launching a product or service. Review by IS Auditor may enable the
business  teams  to  incorporate  additional  controls,  if  required,  in  the
system before the launch.

(cid:131)

(iii) Building Fraud Risk Perspective

In  planning  and  performing  an  audit  to  reduce  risks  to  a  low  level,  the  auditor  should
consider the risk of irregularities and illegal acts. He should maintain professional skepticism
during an audit, recognising the possibility that “material mis-statements due to irregularities
and illegal acts” could exist, irrespective of their evaluation of risk of irregularities and illegal
acts.

IS Auditors are also required to consider and assess the risk of fraud, while performing an
audit.  They  should  design  appropriate  plans,  procedures  and  tests,  to  detect  irregularities,
which can have a material effect on either a specific area under an audit, or the bank as a
whole.  IS  Auditors  should  consider  whether  internal  control  weaknesses  could  result  in
material  irregularities,  not  being  prevented  or  detected.  The  auditor  should  design  and
perform  procedures  to  test  the  appropriateness  of  internal  control  and  risk  of  override  of
controls. They  should  be  reasonably  conversant  with  fraud  risk  factors  and  indicators,  and
assess the risk of irregularities connected with the area under audit.

In  pursuance  to  the  understanding  gathered  during  threat  identification  step  of  the  IT  Risk
Assessment process, the auditors should identify control objectives and activities. These are
required  to  be  tested  to  address  fraud  risk.  He  should  consider  “fraud  vulnerability
assessments”  undertaken  by  the  “Fraud  Risk  Management  Group”,  while  identifying  fraud
risk  factors  in  the  IT  risk  assessment  process.  He  should  be  aware  that  certain  situations
may increase a bank’s vulnerability to fraud risk (e.g. introduction of a new line of business,
new products, new delivery channels and new applications or systems.)

In  preparing  an  audit  scope,  auditors  should  consider  fraud  risk  factors  including
these:
1. Irregularities and illegal acts that are common to banking industry
2.  Corporate  ethics,  organisational  structure,  adequacy  of  supervision,  compensation  and
reward structures, the extent of performance pressures
3. Management's behavior with regard to ethics
4.  Employee  dissatisfaction  resulting  from  potential  layoffs,  outsourcing,  divestiture  or
restructuring
5. Poor financial or operational performance
6. Risk arising out of introduction of new products and processes
7. Bank's history of fraud
8. Recent changes in management teams, operations or IT systems
9. Existence of assets held, or services offered, and their susceptibility to irregularities
10. Strength of relevant controls implemented
11. Applicable regulatory or legal requirements
12. History of findings from previous audits
13.  Findings  of  reviews,  carried  out  outside  the  audit,  such  as  the  findings  from  external
auditors, consultants, quality assurance teams, or specific investigations
14.  Findings  reported  by  management,  which  have  arisen  during  the  day-to-day  course  of

P a g e  | 95

business
15. Technical sophistication and complexity of the information system(s) supporting the area
under audit
16. Existence of in-house (developed or maintained) application systems, as compared with
the packaged software for core business systems

Instances of fraud should be reported to appropriate bank stakeholders:
1.  Frauds  involving  amounts  of  Rs  1  crore  (and  above)  should  be  reported  to  Special
Committee formed to monitor and follow up large fraud cases
2.  Other  fraud  cases  should  be  reported  to  Fraud  Review  Councils  or  independent  groups
formed to manage frauds
3. The status of fraud cases should be reported to Audit Committee as a part of their review
of IS audit
4.  IS  Auditors  should  also  extend  necessary  support  to  Fraud  Review  Councils  or
independent groups or Special Committees in their investigations

(f)  Planning the Execution

The IS Audit Head is responsible for the annual IS Audit Plan, prepared after considering the
risk  assessment  and  scoping  document.  The  plan  covers  overall  audit  strategy,  scoped
areas, details of control objectives identified in the scoping stage, sample sizes, frequency or
timing  of  an  audit  based  on  risk  assessment,  nature  and  extent  of  audit  and  IT  resource
skills availability, deployment and need for any external expertise. A report on the status of
planned  versus  actual  audits,  and  any  changes  to  the  annual  audit  plan,  needs  to  be
periodically presented to Audit Committee and Senior Management on a periodic basis.
There are well-known guidance on IS Audit. The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India
(ICAI), in March 2009, published the “Standard on Internal Audit (SIA) 14: Internal Audit in an
Information Technology Environment” covering requirements of the planning stage, which an
auditor should follow. IIA has provided guidance on defining the IS Audit Universe, through
the guide issued on “Management of IS Auditing” under the “Global Technology Audit Guide”
series.  ITGI  has  provided  guidance  on  audit  planning  in  its  “IT  Assurance  Guide  using
COBIT”.

Suggested guidelines for implementation by banks are as follows:

i.  Documenting the Audit Plan

 The  plan  (either  separately  or  as  part  of  overall  internal  audit  plan)  should  be  a
formal  document,  approved  by  the  Audit  Committee  initially  and  during  any
subsequent major changes. The plan should be prepared so that it is in compliance
with  any  appropriate  external  requirements  in  addition  to  well-known  IS  Auditing
Standards.

Audit Plan Components include:

Internal Audit Subject: Name of the Audit Subject

•
•  Nature  of  Audit:  Compliance  with  legal,  regulatory  or  standards,  performance

metrics assessment or security configuration testing
•  Schedule: Period of audit and its expected duration
•  Scoped  Systems:  Identified  IT  resources  that  are  in  the  scope  based  on  the  risk

assessment process

•  System  Overview:  Details  of  System  Environment  based  on  the  risk  assessment

process

•  Audit Details: Details of risks and controls identified, based on the risk assessment

process

•  Nature  and  Extent  of  Tests:  Controls  testing  for  effectiveness  of  design  and
implementation of controls, substantive testing for operating effectiveness of controls
implemented

P a g e  | 96

•  Method of Internal Audit: Brief audit approach and methodology
•  Team  and  Roles  and  Responsibilities:  Identified  skills  and  names  of  IS Auditors

including their roles and responsibilities

•  Points of Contact: Contact names of auditee department
•  Co-ordination: Names of the project lead and higher official for escalation of issues
•

Information: Report details of past audits on the subject

ii.  Nature and Extent of Tests of Control

Types of testing that can be performed are as below:

•  Test  of  Control  Design:  Controls  that  have  been  identified  are  evaluated  for

appropriateness in mitigating the risks

•  Test of Control Implementation: Tests are performed to confirm that the control that
has  been  appropriately  designed  is  implemented  and  is  operating  at  the  time  of
testing. Mitigating or compensating controls are also reviewed wherever necessary

•  Assessing  Operational  Effectiveness  of  Controls:  Wherever

the  controls
designed are found to be in operation, additional testing is performed for the period of
reliance (audit period) to confirm if they are operating effectively and consistently

On  case-to-case  basis,  the  auditor  should  exercise  professional  judgment  and  decide  the
nature  and  extent  of  procedures  that  need  to  be  adopted  for  conclusions.  ISA  330  gives
guidance on the nature, timing and extent of procedures.

iii.  Sampling techniques

During an audit, auditors should obtain sufficient, reliable and relevant evidence to achieve
their objectives. Findings and conclusions should be supported by appropriate analysis and
interpretation.  Auditors  should  consider  sample  selection  techniques,  which  result  in  a
statistically-based  representative  sample  for  performing  compliance  or  substantive  testing.
Statistical  sampling  involves  the  use  of  techniques  from  which  mathematically-constructed
conclusions  regarding  the  population  can  be  drawn.  Non-statistical  sampling  is  not
statistically-based. Its results should not be extrapolated over the population as a sample is
unlikely  to  be  representative  of  the  population.  Examples  of  compliance  testing  of  controls
where sampling could be considered, include user-access rights, programme change control
procedures, procedures documentation, programme documentation, follow-up of exceptions,
review of logs and software licences audits. Examples of substantive tests where sampling
could be considered, include re-performance of a complex calculation (e.g., interest applied),
on a sample of accounts, sample of transactions to vouch to supporting documentation, etc.

Design of A Sample
While  designing  the  size  and  structure  of  an  audit  sample,  auditors  may  consider  the
following guidelines:
–  Sampling  Unit:  The  unit  will  depend  on  the  sample  purpose.  For  compliance  testing  of
controls, attribute sampling is typically used, where the unit is an event or transaction (e.g., a
control such as an authorisation of transaction).

– Audit objectives: IS Auditors should consider the audit objectives to be achieved and the
audit  procedures,  which  are  most  likely  to  achieve  those  objectives.  In  addition,  when
sampling  is  appropriate,  consideration  should  be  given  to  the  nature  of  the  audit  evidence
sought, and possible error conditions.

–  Population:  Population  is  an  entire  set  of  data  from  which  auditors  wish  to  sample,  in
order to reach a conclusion. Hence, the population from which a sample is drawn, has to be
appropriate and verified as a “complete” for audit objective.

– Stratification: To assist in efficient and effective design of a sample, stratification may be
appropriate.  Stratification  is  a  process  of  dividing  a  population  into  “sub-populations”  with

P a g e  | 97

similar  characteristics,  explicitly  defined,  so  that  each  sample  unit  can  belong  to  only  one
stratum.

Selection of A Sample
IS Auditors should use statistical sampling methods. They may consider using the following:

–  Random  Sampling:  It  ensures  that  all  combinations  of  units  in  the  population  have  an
equal chance of selection

– Systematic Sampling: It involves selecting units using a fixed interval between selections,
the first interval having a random start. Examples include “Monetary Unit Sampling” or “Value
Weighted Selection”, where each individual monetary value (e.g., Rs 100) in the population,
is  given  an  equal  chance  of  selection. As  an  individual  monetary  unit  cannot  ordinarily  be
examined separately, the item which includes that monetary unit is selected for examination.
This  method  systematically  weighs  the  selection  in  favour  of  the  larger  amounts,  but  gives
every monetary value an equal opportunity for selection. Another example includes selecting
every ‘nth sampling unit”.

iv.  Standards and Frameworks

One challenge that the IS Auditors face is knowing what to audit against as a fully-developed
IT  control  baselines  for  applications  and  technologies  that  may  not  have  been  developed.
Rapid  evolution  of  technology  is  likely  to  render  baselines  useless,  after  a  period  of  time.
However, this does not detract from the concept of control objectives.

Control objectives, by definition, should remain more or less constant (from environment to
environment). Consider the objective that critical business data and programmes should be
backed up and recoverable. Now, each environment may do that differently; backups could
be manual, or automated, or a tool may be used. They could be incremental only, or there
may be complete backups of everything. Backups could be done daily, weekly, or monthly.
Storage of backups could be onsite in a fireproof safe, off-site at another company facility, or
outsourced  to  a  third  party.  Method  used  by  the  organisation  to  manage  backups  would
certainly impact the audit procedures and budget, but the control objective will not change.
IS Auditor should be able to start with a set of IT control objectives, and though not specific
to particular environments, select an appropriate framework.

v.  Resource Management

A bank’s auditors play a critical role in efficiency and effectiveness of audits. IT encompasses
a  wide  range  of  technology  and  sophistication—the  skill  set  needed  to  audit  a  Firewall
configuration  is  vastly  different  from  the  skill  set  needed  to  audit  application  controls.  It  is
critical  to  match  the  skills  needed  to  perform  a  particular  IS  Audit,  with  the  appropriate
auditor. IS Auditors should also have the appropriate analytical skills to determine and report
the root cause of deficiencies. Bank’s hiring and training practices should ensure that it has
qualified  IS  Auditors  where  education  and  experience  should  be  consistent  with  job
responsibilities.  Audit  management  should  also  provide  an  effective  programme  of
continuing education and development.

The main issue is having staff with the requisite range of IS Audit skills, needed to audit an
IS Audit universe, effectively. If internal expertise is inadequate, the Board should consider
using qualified external sources, such as management consultants, independent auditors, or
professionals, to supplement internal resources and support bank's objectives.

4)  Executing IS Audit

As mentioned earlier, auditors must understand the business and IT environment, risks and
internal  control  framework.  During  audit,  auditors  should  obtain  evidences,  perform  test

P a g e  | 98

procedures,  appropriately  document  findings,  and  conclude  a  report. This  section  provides
guidance on matters that IS Auditor should consider while executing the Plan.

ICAI, in March 2009, had published a “Standard on Internal Audit (SIA) 14: Internal Audit in
an Information Technology Environment” covering the requirements of executing a plan that
an  IS  Auditor  should  follow.  Additionally,  IIA  has  also  provided  guidance  in  their
“Management  of  IS Auditing”  under  their  “Global Technology Audit  Guide”  series. The  ITGI
has  also  provided  guidance  on execution  of  assurance  initiative  in its “IT Assurance  Guide
Using COBIT”.

Guidance on executing the IS Audit entails the following steps:

−  Refining the understanding of business process and IT environment
−  Refining the scope and identifying internal controls
−  Testing Control Design
−  Testing the outcome of the control objectives
−  Collecting audit evidence
−  Documenting test results
−  Concluding tests performed
−  Considering use of audit accelerators
−  Considering the use of Computer-Aided Automated Tools (CAATs)
−  Considering the work of others
−  Considering third-party review by service providers

The above are covered in the following sections:

(a)  Refine understanding of the business process and IT environment:

The  first  step  of  the  execution  stage  is  refining  the  understanding  of  an  IT  environment,  in
which a review is being planned. This implies understanding of a bank’s business processes
to  confirm  the  correct  scope  and  control  objectives.  The  scope  of  the  IS Audit  need  to  be
communicated to and agreed upon by stakeholders.

Output from this step consists of documented evidence regarding:
– Who performs the task(s), where it is performed and when
– Inputs required to perform the task and outputs generated by it
– Automated tasks performed by systems and system configurations
– System-generated information used by business
– Stated procedures for performing tasks

The IS Auditor can structure this step along the following lines:

Interview and use activity lists and RACI charts

−
−  Collect  and  read  process  description,  policies,  input  or  output,  issues,  meeting

minutes, past audit reports, past audit recommendations, business reports

−  Prepare a scoping task (process objective, goals and metrics)
−  Build an understanding of enterprise IT architecture

(b) Refining Scope and Identifying Internal Controls:
While understanding and evaluating internal controls of a bank, areas mentioned under
“Scope of IS Audit” needs to be covered. However, the nature and extent of control risks
may vary, depending on nature and characteristics of a bank’s information system:
−  Reliance  on  systems  or  programmes  that  are  inaccurately  processing  data,  or

processing inaccurate data, or both

−  Unauthorised  access  to  data  which  may  result  in  destruction  of  data,  or  improper
changes to data, including recording of unauthorised or non-existent transactions, or
inaccurate recording of transactions

−  Possibility  of  IT  personnel  gaining  access  to  privileges,  beyond  those  necessary,  to

P a g e  | 99

perform their assigned duties, thereby breaking down segregation of duties

−  Unauthorised changes to data in master files
−  Unauthorised changes to systems or programmes
−  Failure to make necessary changes to systems or programmes
−
−  Potential loss of data or inability to access data

Inappropriate manual intervention

(c)  Testing Control Design:
This section lists the different techniques that will be used in detailed audit steps. Testing
of controls is performed covering the main test objectives:
−  Evaluation of control design
−  Confirmation that controls are in place within the operation
−  Assess the operational effectiveness of controls
−  Additionally, control efficiency could be tested

In the testing phase, different types of testing can be applied.  Five generic testing methods
include  enquire  and  confirm,  inspect,  compare  actual  with  expected  findings,  re-perform  or
re-calculate  and  review  automated  evidence  collection  through  analyzing  date  using
computer assisted audit techniques and extracting exceptions or key transactions.

To  assess  the  adequacy  of  the  design  of  controls  the  following  steps  should  be
performed:
–  Observe,  inspect  and  review  control  approach.  Test  the  design  for  completeness,
relevance, timeliness and measurability
–  Enquire  whether,  or  confirm  that,  the  responsibilities  for  control  practices  and  overall
accountability have been assigned
– Test  whether  accountability  and  responsibilities  are  understood  and  accepted.  Verify  that
the right skills and the necessary resources are available
–  Enquire  through  interviews  with  key  staff  involved  whether  they  understand  the  control
mechanism, its purpose and the accountability and responsibilities.
IS Auditor must determine whether:

−  Documented control processes exist
−  Appropriate evidence of control processes exists
−  Responsibility and accountability are clear and effective
−  Compensating controls exist, where necessary

Additionally, specifically in internal audit assignments, cost-effectiveness of a control design
may also be verified, with the following audit steps:
– If the control design is effective: Investigate whether it can be made more efficient by
optimising  steps,  looking  for  synergies  with  other  mechanisms,  and  reconsidering  the
balance  of  prevention  versus  detection  and  correction.  Consider  the  effort  spent  in
maintaining the control practices
–  If  the  control  is  operating  effectively:  Investigate  whether  it  can  be  made  more  cost-
effective.  Consider  analysing  performance  metrics  of  activities  associated,  automation
opportunities or skill level

(d) Test the Outcome of Control Objectives

Audit steps performed ensure that control measures established are working as prescribed
and conclude on the appropriateness of the control environment. To test the effectiveness of
a control, the auditor needs to look for direct and indirect evidence of the control’s impact on
the  process  outputs.  This  implies  the  direct  and  indirect  substantiation  of  measurable
contribution of the control to the IT, process and activity goals, thereby recording direct and
indirect evidence of actually achieving the outcomes or various control objectives (based on
those documented in standards like COBIT, as relevant).

P a g e  | 100

The auditor should obtain direct or indirect evidence for selected items or periods to ensure
that  the  control  under  review  is  working  effectively  by  applying  a  selection  of  testing
techniques as presented in step on test of control design. The IS Auditor should also perform
a  limited  review  of  the  adequacy  of  the  process  deliverables,  determine  the  level  of
substantive testing and additional work needed to provide assurance that the IT process is
adequate.  Substantive  testing  would  involve  performing  analytical  procedures  and  tests  of
details,  to  gain  assurance  on  areas  where  control  weaknesses  are  observed.  Substantive
testing is performed to ascertain the actual impact of control weaknesses.

(e)  Audit Evidence

IS  Auditors  should  obtain  sufficient  and  reliable  audit  evidence  to  draw  reasonable
conclusions on which to base the audit results.

Sufficient  Evidence:  Evidence  can  be  considered  sufficient  if  it  supports  all  material
questions  in  the  audit  objective  and  scope.  Evidence  should  be  objective  and  sufficient  to
enable  a  qualified  independent  party  to  re-perform  tests  and  obtain  the  same  results.  The
evidence  should  be  commensurate  with  the  materiality  of  an  item  and  risks  involved.  In
instances  where  IS  Auditor  believes  sufficient  audit  evidence  cannot  be  obtained,  they
should disclose this in a manner consistent with the communication of the audit results.

Appropriate Evidence: Appropriate evidence shall include the following indicative criteria:

-  Procedures as performed by the IS Auditor
-  Results of procedures performed by the IS Auditor
-  Source  documents

(electronic  or  paper),

records  and  corroborating

information used to support the audit

-  Findings and results of an audit

When  obtaining  evidence  from  a  test  of  control  design,  auditors  should  consider  the
completeness of an audit evidence to support the assessed level of control risk.

Reliable Evidence: IS Auditors should take note of following examples of evidence that is
more reliable when it is:
– Written form and not oral expressions
– Obtained from independent sources
– Obtained by IS Auditors, rather than from the bank being audited
– Certified by an independent party

Procedures  used  to  gather  evidence  can  be  applied  through  the  use  of  manual  audit
procedures,  computer-assisted  techniques,  or  a  combination  of  both.  For  example:  a
system,  which  uses  manual  control  totals  to  balance  data  entry  operations  might  provide
audit evidence that the control procedure is in place by way of an appropriately reconciled
and annotated report. IS Auditors should obtain audit evidence by reviewing and testing this
report.  Detailed  transaction  records  may  only  be  available  in  machine-readable  format,
requiring IS Auditors to obtain evidence using computer-assisted techniques.

When  information  produced  by  a  bank  is  used  by  auditors,  they  should  obtain  evidence
about the completeness and accuracy by the following means:

−  Performing  tests  of  the  operating  effectiveness  of  controls  over  the  production  and

maintenance of information, to be used as audit evidence

−  Performing audit procedures directly on information to be used as audit evidence

Auditors  should  consider  the  following  controls  over  production  and  maintenance  of
information produced by a bank:
– Controls over the integrity, accuracy, and completeness of the source data
– Controls over the creation and modification of the applicable report logic and parameters

(f)  Documentation

Audit  evidence  gathered  should  be  documented  and  organised  to  support  findings  and
conclusions.  IS  Audit  documentation  is  a  record  of  the  work  performed  and  evidence
supporting findings and conclusions.
The potential uses of documentation:

−  Demonstration  of  the  extent  to  which  the  auditor  has  complied  with  professional

standards related to IS auditing

−  Assistance with audit planning, performance and review
−  Facilitation of third-party reviews
−  Evaluation of the auditors’ quality assurance programme
−  Support in circumstances such as insurance claims, fraud cases and lawsuits
−  Assistance with professional development of the staff

Documentation should include, at a minimum, a record of:
– Planning and preparation of the audit scope and objectives
– Audit steps performed and audit evidence gathered
– Audit findings, conclusions and recommendations
– Reports issued as a result of the audit work
– Supervisory review

Extent of an IS Auditor’s documentation may depend on needs for a particular audit
and should include such things as:

IS Auditor’s understanding of an area to be audited, and its environment

−
−  His  understanding  of  the  information  processing  systems  and  internal  control

environment

−  Audit evidence, source of audit documentation and date of completion
−  Bank’s response to recommendations

Documentation should include audit information, required by law, government regulations, or
by  applicable  professional  standards.  Documentation  should  be  clear,  complete  and
understandable,  by  a  reviewer.  IS Audit  owns  evidences  documented  by  them,  in  order  to
substantiate  conclusions  on  tests  performed  and  specific  observations  reported  to
management and Audit Committee.

(g) Conclusion on Tests Performed

IS  Auditors  should  evaluate  conclusions  drawn  as  a  basis  for  forming  an  opinion  on  the
audit. Conclusions should be substantiated by evidences, collected and documented. The IS
Audit Team  may  be  required  to  provide  and  maintain  evidences  in  respect  of  observations
reported by them.

IS Auditors may perform following activities required to conclude on tests performed based
on nature and amount of identified control failures and likelihood of undetected errors:

–  Decide  whether  the  scope  of  IS  Audit  was  sufficient  to  enable  the  auditors  to  draw
reasonable conclusions on which to base audit opinion
−  Perform  audit  procedures  designed  to  obtain  sufficient  appropriate  audit  evidence:

events upto the date of audit report may be included and identified in the report

−  Prepare  an  audit  summary  memorandum  documenting  findings  and  conclusions  on
important  issues  of  IS  Auditing  and  reporting,  including  judgments  made  by  an  IS
Audit team

−  Obtain appropriate representations from bank management
−  Prepare  a  report  appropriate  to  circumstances,  and  in  conformity  with,  applicable

professional standards and regulatory and legal requirements

P a g e  | 102

−  Communicate, as necessary, with Audit Committee or Senior Management
−  Maintain effective controls over processing and distribution of reports relating to the

IS Audit

If  audit  evidence  or  information  indicate  that  irregularities  could  have  occurred,  IS  auditors
should  recommend  the  bank  management  on  matters  that  require  detailed  investigation  to
enable  the  management  to  initiate  appropriate  investigative  actions.  The  auditors  should
also  consider  consulting  the Audit  Committee  and  legal  counsel  about  the  advisability  and
risks of reporting the findings outside the Bank.

RBI  (vide  its  circular  DBS.CO.FrMC.BC.No.7/23.04.001/  2009-10,  dated:  September  16,
2009) requires that fraud cases should be reported to law enforcement agencies and to the
RBI.  Banks  should  appropriately  include  requirements  for  reporting  to  RBI,  of  such
instances, in engagement letters issued to external IS Auditors.

(h) Audit Accelerators

Since  IS Audit  budgets  can  be  difficult  to  estimate  and  manage,  CAEs  can  consider  using
testing  accelerators—tools  or  techniques  that  help  support  procedures  that  the  IS Auditors
will be performing —to increase efficiency and effectiveness. CAEs can use an accelerator
to do the same audit in less time, or do more detailed audit procedures in the same amount
of time. Audit accelerators can be divided into two categories:
– Audit  Facilitators:  Tools  that  help  support  the  overall  management  of  an  audit  (e.g.,  an
electronic workpaper management tool)
–  Testing  Accelerators:  Tools  that  automate  the  performance  of  audit  tests  (e.g.,  data
analysis tools).

Audit Facilitators
These include Electronic Workpapers, project management software, flow charting software
and open issue tracking software.

Testing Accelerators
Testing  accelerators  can  automate  time-consuming  audit  tasks,  such  as  reviewing  large
populations  of  data.  Also,  using  a  tool  to  perform  audit  procedures  helps  establish
consistency.  For  example,  if  a  tool  is  used  to  assess  server  security  configuration,  servers
tested  with  that  tool  will  be  assessed  along  the  same  baselines.  Performing  these
procedures manually allows for a degree of interpretation on the part of the IS Auditor. Lastly,
the  use  of  tools  enables  IS Auditors  to  test  an  entire  population  of  data,  rather  than  just  a
sample of transactions. This provides for a much higher degree of audit assurance.

Data  Analysis  Software:  These  allow  an  auditor  to  perform  robust  statistical  analysis  of
large  data  sets.  They  can  also  be  used  to  support  process  or  operational  audits  like  KYC
reviews. They  can  support  types  of  testing.  One  consideration  when  using  a  data  analysis
tool is that it may be difficult to extract the data from the original source. It is critical that audit
procedures be performed to ensure the completeness and accuracy of the source data.

Security Analysis Tools: These are a broad set of tools that can review a large population
of  devices  or  users  and  identify  security  exposures.  There  are  different  types  of  security
analysis tools. Generally they can be categorised as follows:

−  Network Analysis Tools: These consist of software programmes that can be run on a
network and gather information about it. IS Auditors can use these tools for a variety
of audit procedures, including:

Verifying the accuracy of network diagrams by mapping corporate network
Identifying key network devices that may warrant additional audit attention
Gathering information about what traffic is permitted across a network (which would directly
support the IT risk assessment process).

P a g e  | 103

−  Hacking Tools: Most technologies have a number of standard vulnerabilities, such as
the existence of default IDs and passwords or default settings when the technology is
installed out-of-the-box. Hacking tools provide for an automated method of checking
for  these.  Such  tools  can  be  targeted  against  Firewalls,  servers,  networks  and
operating systems.

−  Application  Security  Analysis  Tools:  If  an  organisation  is  using  large  integrated
business application, key internal controls are highly security dependent. Application-
level  security  must  be  well-designed  and  built  in  conjunction  with  the  application’s
processes and controls.

The  CAE  should  be  aware  that  most  of  these  come  with  a  set  of  pre-configured  rules,  or
vendor-touted  “best  practices”.  Implementation  of  one  will  need  to  be  accompanied  by  a
substantive project to create a rule set that is relevant for that particular organisation. Failure
to  do  so  will  result  in  audit  reports  that  contain  a  number  of  either  false-positives  or  false-
negatives.

CAEs should be aware of the following considerations, with respect to IS Audit Accelerators:
−  Tools cost money. The CAE should be sure that the benefits outweigh the costs
−  That  IS Auditors  will  need  to  be  trained  on  the  new  tool.  It  is  not  uncommon  that  a

tool sits unused in an Internal Audit Department

−  That the tool will need support, patch management and upgrades. Depending on the
quality, it may require a standalone server, as well. For this, any tool selection should
be managed with the IT department’s assistance

Sometimes, IT management or third-party service providers are not allowed tools to access
the  production  environment  directly.  They  are  instead  asked  to  do  so  from  a  copy  of  data
from an alternative site, or standby server. Any use of tools or scripts should be thoroughly
discussed with and approved by IT management and be tested fully before deploying.

(i)  Computer-Assisted Audit Techniques (CAATS)

IS Auditors can use an appropriate combination of manual techniques and CAATs. IS Audit
function needs to enhance the use of CAATs, particularly for critical functions or processes
carrying financial or regulatory or legal implications. The extent to which CAATs can be used
will  depend  on  factors  such  as  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  CAATs  over  manual
techniques,  time  constraints,  integrity  of  the  Information  System  and  IT  environment  and
level of audit risk.

CAATs may be used in critical areas ( like detection of revenue leakage, treasury functions,
assessing  impact  of  control  weaknesses,  monitoring  customer  transactions  under  AML
requirements and generally in areas where a large volume of transactions are reported).
Process involved in using CAATs involve the following steps:

−  Set audit objectives of CAATs
−  Determine  accessibility  and  availability  of  a  bank’s  IS  facilities,  programs,  systems

and data

−  Define  procedures  to  be  undertaken  (e.g.,  statistical  sampling,  recalculation,  or

confirmation)

−  Define output requirements
−  Determine  resource  requirements:  i.e.  personnel,  CAATs,  processing  environment,

bank’s IS facilities or audit IS facilities

−  Obtain  access  to  the  bank’s  IS  facilities,  programmes,  systems  and  data,  including

file definitions

−  Document  CAATs  to  be  used,  including  objectives,  high-level  flowcharts,  and  run

instructions

CAATs may be used to perform the following audit procedures among others:

P a g e  | 104

– Test of transactions and balances, such as recalculating interest
– Analytical review procedures, such as identifying inconsistencies or significant fluctuations
–  Compliance  tests  of  general  controls:  testing  set-up  or  configuration  of  the  operating
system, or access procedures to the programme libraries
– Sampling programmes to extract data for audit testing
–  Compliance  tests  of  application  controls  such  as  testing  functioning  of  a  programmed
control
– Re-calculating entries performed by the entity’s accounting systems
– Penetration testing

In  instances,  where  CAATs  may  be  used  to  extract  sensitive  programmes,  system
information  or  production  data,  IS  Auditors  should  safeguard  the  programme,  system
information  or  production  data,  with  an  appropriate  level  of  confidentiality  and  security.  In
doing so, IS Auditors should consider the level of confidentiality and security required by the
bank, owning the data and any relevant legislation. IS Auditors should be provided with “view
access”  to  systems  and  data.  In  case  audit  procedures  cannot  be  performed  in  the  live
environment, appropriate test environment should be made available to IS Auditors. Systems
and data under test environment should be synchronised to the live environment.

IS  Auditors  should  use  and  document  results  of  appropriate  procedures  to  provide  for
ongoing  integrity,  reliability,  usefulness  and  security  of  the  CAATs.  Example:  this  should
include  a  review  of  programme  maintenance  and  change  controls  over  embedded  audit
software to determine that only authorised changes were made to the CAATs.

In instances where CAATs reside in an environment not under the control of the IS Auditor,
an  appropriate  level  of  control  should,  in  effect,  be  placed  to  identify  changes.  When  the
CAATs  are  changed,  IS  Auditors  should  obtain  assurance  of  their  integrity,  reliability,
usefulness  and  security,  through  appropriate  planning,  design,  testing,  processing  and
review of documentation, before placing their reliance.

(j)  Continuous Auditing

Traditionally, testing of controls performed by an internal audit team was on a retrospective
and  cyclical  basis,  often  many  months  after  business  activities  have  occurred.  The  testing
procedures have often been based on a sampling approach. They included activities such as
reviews  of  policies,  procedures,  approvals  and  reconciliations.  Today,  however,  it  is
recognised that this approach only affords internal auditors a narrow scope, and is often too
late to be of “real value” to business performance or regulatory compliance.

Continuous auditing is a method used to perform control and risk assessments automatically
on  a  more  frequent  basis  using  technology  which  is  key  to  enabling  such  an  approach.
Continuous  auditing  changes  the  audit  paradigm  from  periodic  reviews  of  a  sample  of
transactions to ongoing audit testing of 100 percent of transactions. It becomes an integral
part  of  modern  auditing  at  many  levels.  It  also  should  be  closely  tied  to  management
activities  such  as  performance  monitoring,  scorecard  or  dashboard  and  enterprise  risk
management.

A  continuous  audit  approach  allows  internal  auditors  to  fully  understand  critical  control
points,  rules,  and  exceptions.  With  automated,  frequent  analyses  of  data,  they  are  able  to
perform control and risk assessments in real time or near  real time. They can analyse key
business systems for both anomalies at the transaction level and for data-driven indicators of
control deficiencies and emerging risk.

Finally,  with  continuous  auditing,  the  analysis  results  are  integrated  into  all  aspects  of  the
audit  process,  from  the  development  and  maintenance  of  the  enterprise  audit  plan  to  the
conduct  and  follow-up  of  specific  audits.  Depending  on  the  level  of  implementation  and

P a g e  | 105

sustenance  of  risk-based  IS  Audit  approach;  banks  may  explore  implementation  of
continuous auditing in critical areas in a phased manner.

(k)  Application Control Audit:

Detailed pre-implementation application control audits and data migration audits in respect of
critical systems needs to be subjected to independent external audit. Banks also need to
conduct  a  post-implementation  detailed  application  control  audit.    Furthermore,  banks
should  also  include  application  control  audits  in  a  risk  based  manner  as  part  of  the
regular  Internal Audit/IS Audit  plans  with  focus  on  data  integrity  (among  other  factors).
General internal auditors with requisite functional knowledge need to be involved along
with the IS Auditors in the exercise to provide the requisite domain expertise.

Some of the considerations in application control audit (based on ISACA guidelines) include:
i.  An  IS  Auditor  should  understand  the  IS  environment  to  determine  the  size  and
complexity of the systems, and the extent of dependence on information systems by
the bank

ii.  Application-level risks at system and data-level include, system integrity risks relating
to the incomplete, inaccurate, untimely or unauthorized processing of data; system-
security risks relating to unauthorized access to systems or data; data risks relating
to  its  completeness,  integrity,  confidentiality  and  accuracy;  system-availability  risks
relating to the lack of system operational capability; and system maintainability risks
in terms of adequate change control procedures.

iii.  Application  controls  to  address  the  application-level  risks  may  be  in  the  form  of
computerized  controls  built  into  the  system,  manually  performed  controls,  or  a
combination of both. Risks of manual controls in critical areas need to be considered.
Where the option to place reliance on programmed controls is taken, relevant general
IT controls should be considered, as well as controls specifically relevant to the audit
objective.  Objectives  should  be  developed  to  address  criteria  such  as  integrity,
availability, compliance, reliability and confidentiality. Effectiveness and efficiency can
also be additional criteria.

iv.  As part of documenting the flow of transactions, information gathered should include
both computerized and manual aspects of the system. Focus should be on data input
(electronic  or  manual),  processing,  storage  and  output  which  are  of  significance  to
the audit objective.

v.  Consideration should also be given to documenting application interfaces with other
systems. The auditor may confirm the documentation by performing procedures such
as a walk-through test.

vi.  Specific  controls  to  mitigate  application  risks  may  be  identified.  Sufficient  audit
evidence  obtained  to  assure  the  auditor  that  controls  are  operating  as  intended
through  procedures  such  as  inquiry  and  observation,  review  of  documentation  and
testing  of  the  application  system  controls,  where  programmed  controls  are  being
tested.  Use  of  computer-assisted  audit  techniques  (CAATs)  also  needs  to  be
considered.

vii.  Nature, timing and extent of testing should be based on the level of risk to the area
under  review  and  audit  objectives.  In  absence  of  strong  general  IT  controls,  an  IS
auditor may make an assessment of the effect of this weakness on the reliability of
the computerized application controls.

viii. If an IS auditor finds significant weaknesses in the computerized application controls,
assurance  should  be  obtained  (depending  on  the  audit  objective),  if  possible,  from
the manually performed processing controls.

ix.  Effectiveness  of  computerized  controls  is  dependent  on  general  IT  controls.
Therefore, if general IT controls are not reviewed, ability to place reliance on controls
may be limited. Then the IS Auditor should consider alternative procedures.

x.  Where  weaknesses  identified  during  the  application  systems  review  are  considered

P a g e  | 106

to be significant or material, appropriate level of management should be advised to
undertake immediate corrective action.

(l)  Using the Work of Others

Purpose of an IS Audit standard is to establish and provide a guidance to auditors who can
use the work of experts on an audit. The following are standards, to test the reliability of the
work of an expert:

i.

IS Auditors  should,  where  appropriate,  consider  using  the  work  of  other  experts  for
audit

ii.  They  should  assess,  and

then  be  satisfied  with  professional  qualifications,
competencies,  relevant  experience,  resources,  independence  and  quality  control
processes, prior to engagement

−  They should assess, review and evaluate work of experts, as a part of an audit, and

then conclude the extent of use and reliance of the work

−  They  should  determine  and  conclude  whether  the  work  of  experts  is  adequate  and
competent to enable them to conclude on current audit objectives. Such conclusion
should be documented

−  They  should  apply  additional  test  procedures  to  gain  and  include  scope  limitation,

where required evidence is not obtained through additional test procedures

−  An  expert  could  be  an  IS  Auditor  from  external  auditing  firm,  a  management
consultant,  an  IT  domain  expert,  or  an  expert  in  the  area  of  audit,  who  has  been
appointed by management or by the IS Audit Team

−  An  expert  could  be  internal  or  external  to  the  bank.  If  an  expert  is  engaged  by
another part of the organisation, reliance may be place on the banks' report. In some
cases, this may reduce the need of an IS Audit coverage, though IS Auditors do not
have supporting documentation and work papers. IS Auditors should be cautious in
providing an opinion on such cases

−  An IS Auditor should have access to all papers, supporting documents and reports of
other  experts,  where  such  access  does  not  create  legal  issues.  Where  access
creates  legal  issues,  or  such  papers  are  not  accessible,  auditors  should  determine
and conclude on the extent of use and reliance on expert’s work

−  The  IS  Auditor’s  views,  relevance  and  comments  on  adopting  the  expert’s  report

should form a part of the IS Auditor’s Report

(m) Third Party Review of Service Providers

financial  and  operational

A  bank  may  use  a  third-party  service  provider  (service  organisation)  to  obtain  services  of
packaged  software  applications  and  technology  environment,  which  enables  customers  to
process
transactions  (ATM  management,  networking  and
infrastructure  development  and  maintenance,  document  imaging  and  indexing,  software
development and maintenance). RBI has issued “Guidelines on Managing Risks and Code
of  Conduct
(circular  no:
in  Outsourcing  of  Financial  Services  by  Banks”
DBOD.NO.BP.40/21.04.158/ 2006-07 dated November 3, 2006), asking banks to adhere to
guidelines before outsourcing activities related to financial services.

Services  provided  by  a  third  party  are  relevant  to  the  scope  of  IS Audit.  Especially,  when
those  services  and  controls  within  them,  are  a  part  of  the  bank’s  information  systems.
Though  controls  at  the  service  organisation  are  likely  to  relate  to  financial  reporting,  there
may be other controls that may also be relevant to the IS Audit (controls over safeguarding
of assets or document images).
A service organisation’s services are a part of a bank’s information system, including related
business processes, relevant to IS Audit if these services affect any of the following:

•  Segments of Information System that are significant to the bank’s IS operations
•  Procedures  within  information  system,  by  which  an  user  entity’s  transactions  are

P a g e  | 107

initiated, recorded, processed, corrected (when necessary), transferred to a general
ledger and reported, in financial statements

•  The  way  events  and  conditions,  other  than  transactions,  significant  to  bank’s

Information System are captured

IS Auditors  will  have  to  obtain  an  understanding  of  how  a  bank  uses  services  of  a  service
organisation in the bank’s IS operations, including:

−  Nature  of  services  provided  by  the  organisation  and  significance  of  those  to  the
bank’s information system, including the effect thereof on the bank’s internal control
−  Nature  and  materiality  of  transactions,  accounts  or  financial  reporting  processes,

affected by the service organisation

−  Degree of interaction between activities of the organisation and bank
−  Nature  of  relationship  between  the  bank  and  organisation,  including  relevant

contractual terms for activities undertaken by the organisation

In  situations,  services  provided  by  the  organisation  may  not  appear  to  be  “material”  to  the
bank’s IS operations. But, the service nature may be. IS Auditors should determine that an
understanding of those controls is necessary in the circumstances. Information on the nature
of services, provided by an organisation, may be available from a variety of sources:

−  User manual
−  System overview
−  Technical manuals
−  Contract or service-level agreement between the bank and organisation
−  Reports  by  service  organisation,  internal  auditors,  or  regulatory  authorities,  on

service organisation controls

−  Reports  by  an  auditor  of  the  organisation  (service  auditor),  including  management

letters

IS Auditors  may  use  a  service  auditor  to  perform  procedures  such  as  tests  of  controls  at
service  organisation,  or  substantive  procedures  on  the  bank’s  IS  operations,  served  by  a
service organisation.

5)  Reporting and Follow-up

This  phase  involves  reporting  audit  findings  to  the  CAE  and  Audit  Committee.  Before
reporting  the  findings,  it  is  imperative  that  IS  Auditors  prepare  an  audit  summary
memorandum  providing  overview  of  the  entire  audit  processing  from  planning  to  audit
findings, discuss the findings with auditee and obtain responses. Additionally, reviewing the
actions  taken  by  management  to  mitigate  the  risks  observed  in  audit  findings  and
appropriately updating the audit summary memorandum is also important. Reporting entails
deciding the nature, timing and extent of follow-up activities and planning future audits.

Professional bodies like ISACA, IIA, ICAI have issued guidance in this regard.
Reporting and follow-up entails following activities or steps:
– Drafting audit summary and memorandum
– Discussing findings with management
– Finalising and submitting reports
– Reviewing the Actions taken report
– Undertaking follow-up procedures
– Archiving documents

These are covered in the following sections:

(a)  Audit Summary and Memorandum: An IS Auditor should perform audits or reviews
of control procedures and form a conclusion about, and reporting on, the design and

P a g e  | 108

operating effectiveness of the control procedures based on the identified criteria. The
conclusion for an audit is expressed as a positive expression of opinion and provides
a high level of assurance. The conclusion for a review is expressed as a statement of
negative assurance and provides only a moderate level of assurance.

(b)  Discuss  Findings  with  Management:  Bank’s  management  is  responsible  for
deciding the appropriate action to be taken in response to reported observations and
recommendations.  IS  Auditors  are  responsible  for  assessing  such  management
action  for  appropriateness  and  the  timely  resolution  of  the  matters  reported  as
observations and recommendations.

Senior  Management  may  decide  to  accept  the  risk  of  not  correcting  the  reported
condition because of cost or other considerations. The Board (or the Audit Committee, if
one  exists)  should  be  informed  of  Senior  Management’s  decision  on  significant
observations and recommendations. When Auditors IS believes that an organisation has
accepted  a  level  of  residual  risk  that  is  inappropriate  for  the  organisation,  they  should
discuss the matter with Internal Audit and Senior Management. If the IS Auditors are not
in  agreement  with  the  decision,  regarding  residual  risk,  IS  Auditors  and  Senior
Management should report the matter to the Board, or Audit Committee, for resolution.

Events sometimes occur, subsequent to the point in time or period of time of the subject
matter being tested, but prior to the date of the IS Auditor’s report, that have a material
effect  on  the  subject  matter  and  therefore  require  adjustment  or  disclosure  in  the
presentation of the subject matter or assertion.

(c)  Finalise and Submit Reports

IS Auditors should review and assess the conclusions drawn from the evidence obtained as
the basis for forming an opinion on the effectiveness of the control procedures based on the
identified criteria.
Major  findings  identified  during  an  audit  should  have  a  definite  time  line  indicated  for
remedial  actions,  these  should  be  followed  up  intensively  and  compliance  should  be
confirmed.
An  IS  Auditor’s  report  about  the  effectiveness  of  control  procedures  should  cover  aspects
like:
– Description of the scope of the audit, including:

– Identification or description of the area of activity
– Criteria used as a basis for the IS Auditor’s conclusion
– A statement that the maintenance of an effective internal control structure, including
control procedures for the area of activity, is the responsibility of management
– A statement that IS Auditors have conducted the engagement to express an opinion on the
effectiveness of control

(d) Review Action Taken Report

timely  manner.

After  reporting  of  findings  and  recommendations,  IS Auditors  should  request  and  evaluate
relevant information to conclude whether appropriate action has been taken by management
in  a
reported
If  management’s  proposed  actions
recommendations  have  been  discussed  with,  or  provided  to,  the  IS Auditor,  these  actions
should  be  recorded  as  a  management  response  in  the  final  report. The  nature,  timing  and
extent  of  the  follow-up  activities  should  take  into  account  the  significance  of  the  reported
finding  and  the  impact  if  corrective  action  is  not  taken.  The  timing  of  IS  Audit  follow-up
activities  in  relation  to  the  original  reporting  should  be  a  matter  of  professional  judgment
dependent  on  a  number  of  considerations,  such  as  the  nature  or  magnitude  of  associated
risks and costs to the entity.

implement

to

(e)  Follow-up Procedures

P a g e  | 109

Procedures for follow-up activities should be established which includes:
– The recording of a time frame within which management should respond to agreed-upon
recommendations
– An evaluation of management’s response
– A verification of the response, if thought appropriate
– Follow-up work, if thought appropriate
–  A  communications  procedure  that  escalates  outstanding  and  unsatisfactory  responses/
actions to the appropriate levels of management
– A process for providing reasonable assurance of management’s assumption of associated
risks, in the event that remedial action is delayed or not proposed to be implemented
–  An  automated  tracking  system  or  database  can  assist  in  the  carrying  out  of  follow-up
activities.

(f)  Update Audit Summary Memorandum

An audit summary memorandum should be prepared and addresses the following:
– Conclusion about specific risk
–Changes in the bank, its environment and banking industry that come to the attention after
the completion of the audit planning memorandum and that caused to change audit plan
–Conclusion regarding the appropriateness of the going concern assumption and the effect,
if any, on financial statements
–The result of subsequent reviews and conclusion regarding the effect of subsequent events
on financial statements
–Conclusion reached in evaluation of misstatements, including disclosure deficiencies
–If  contradiction  or  inconsistency  with  final  conclusion  regarding  a  significant  matter  is
observed, there should be proper documentation of addressing the inconsistency
–Conclusion  of  whether  the  audit  procedures  performed  and  the  audit  evidence  obtained
were appropriate and consistent to support the audit conclusion

(g) Archival of Documents

Banks are recommended to have an archiving/ retention policy to archive the audit results.
Banks to have an archiving policy that:
– Ensures integrity of the data
– Defines appropriate access rights
– Decides on the appropriate archiving media
– Ensures ease of recovery

6)  Quality Review

This section is aimed at emphasising quality of work of IS Auditors, while performing duties
as  an  auditor.  Appropriate  levels  in  IS  Audit  function  are  recommended  to  assess  audit
quality  by  reviewing  documentation,  ensuring  appropriate  supervision  of  IS Audit  members
and assessing whether IS Audit members have taken due care while performing their duties.
This will bring efficiency, control and improve quality of the IS Audit.

(a)  Evidences and Documentation

IS  Auditors  may  perform  the  following  progressive  reviews  of  the  evidences  and
documentation:
– A detailed review of each working paper prepared by a less-experienced member of the IS
Audit  team,  by  a  more  experienced  member,  who  did  not  participate  in  the  preparation  of
such working paper
– A primary  review of the evidences and documentation by the Manager or IS Audit Head.
Where  the  manager  performs  a  primary  review,  this  does  not  require  that  each  working
paper  be  reviewed  in  detail  by  the  manager,  as  each  working  paper  has  already  been
reviewed in detail by the person who performed the detailed review.
– An overriding review of the working papers by the CAE, as needed

P a g e  | 110

(b)  Supervision

IS Audit staff should be supervised to provide reasonable assurance that audit objectives are
accomplished and applicable professional auditing standards are met.

(c)  Due Care

The standard of “due care” is that level of diligence which a prudent and competent person
would  exercise  under  a  given  set  of  circumstances.  “Due  professional  care”  applies  to  an
individual  who  professes  to  exercise  a  special  skill  such  as  IS  auditing.  Due  professional
care requires the individual to exercise that skill to a level commonly possessed by auditors
with the specialty.

Due  professional  care  applies  to  the  exercise  of  professional  judgment  in  the  conduct  of
work  performed.  It  implies  that  the  professional  approaches  matters  requiring  professional
judgment  with  proper  diligence.  Despite  the  exercise  of  due  professional  care  and
professional  judgment,  situations  may  arise  where  an  incorrect  conclusion  may  be  drawn
from  a  diligent  review  of  the  available  facts  and  circumstances. Therefore,  the  subsequent
discovery of incorrect conclusions does not, in and of itself, indicate inadequate professional
judgment or lack of diligence on the part of the IS Auditor.

Due professional care should extend to every aspect of the audit, including the evaluation of
audit  risk,  the  formulation  of  audit  objectives,  the  establishment  of  the  audit  scope,  the
selection of audit tests, and the evaluation of test results.

In doing this, IS Auditors should determine or evaluate:

−  Type and level of audit resources required to meet audit objectives
−  Significance of identified risks and the potential effect of such risks on the audit
−  Audit evidence gathered
−  Competence, integrity and conclusions of others upon whose work IS Auditors places

reliance

Intended  recipients  of  audit  reports  have  an  appropriate  expectation  that  IS Auditors  have
exercised  due  professional  care  throughout  the  course  of  the  audit.  IS Auditors  should  not
accept an assignment unless adequate skills, knowledge, and other resources are available
to complete the work in a manner expected of a professional. IS Auditors should conduct the
audit with diligence while adhering to professional standards. IS Auditors should disclose the
circumstances  of  any  non-compliance  with  professional  standards  in  a  manner  consistent
with the communication of the audit results.

(d)  Independent Assurance of the Audit function

With a view to provide assurance to bank’s management and regulators, banks are required
to conduct a quality assurance, at least  once in three  years, on the bank's Internal Audit,
including  IS  Audit  function,  to  validate  approach  and  practices  adopted  by  them  in  the
discharge of its responsibilities as laid out in the Audit Policy.

Objectives of performing a quality assessment are:

−  Assess  efficiency  and  effectiveness  of  an  Internal  Audit  for  current  and  future

business goals

−  Determine value addition from Internal Audit to the business units
Benchmark, identify and recommend, successful practices of Internal Audit
−  Assess compliance to standards for professional practice of Internal Audit

Others:

As a matter of prudence, banks should rotate IS Auditors in a specific area on periodic basis,

P a g e  | 111

say atleast once in two years. The same needs to be incorporated in IS Audit policy/charter.
Further,  in  order  to  avoid  conflict  of  interest  an  audit  firm/consultant  who  had  provided
consulting  services  on  a  specific  area  should  not  audit  the  area  as  part  of  pre  or  post
implementation audit.

CHAPTER 6 – CYBER FRAUD

Introduction:

With the advances in information technology, most banks in India have migrated to core
banking  platforms  and  have  moved  transactions  to  payment  cards  (debit  and  credit
cards)  and  to  electronic  channels  like  ATMs,  Internet  Banking  and  Mobile  Banking.
Fraudsters have also followed customers into this space. However, the response of most
of  the  banks  to  frauds  in  these  areas  needs  further  improvement,  thereby  avoiding
putting the entire onus on the customer. There is also a lack of clarity amongst banks on
the reporting of these instances as frauds.

A  need  is  therefore  felt  to  have  an  industry  wide  framework  on  fraud  governance  with
particular  emphasis  on  tackling  electronic  channel  based  frauds.  This  note  endeavours
to bring out the challenges and suggests a framework which can be implemented across
banks  to  effectively  tackle  the  electronic  fraud  menace.  It  would  be  useful  to  recall  the
definition of fraud at this stagyuo]\j;’e.

‘A deliberate act of omission or commission by any person, carried out in the course
of  a  banking  transaction  or  in  the  books  of  accounts  maintained  manually  or  under
computer system in banks, resulting into wrongful gain to any person for a temporary
period or otherwise, with or without any monetary loss to the bank’.

This definition has been recommended as per para 9.1 of the Report of the Study Group
on Large Value Bank Frauds set up by the Reserve Bank of India in 1997. It follows that
like other bank frauds, various IT related frauds need to get captured through the fraud
reporting system and banks should take adequate steps to mitigate such risks.

1. Roles/Responsibilities and Organizational structure for fraud risk management:

(a)  Indian banks follow the RBI guideline of reporting all frauds above

 1 crore to their
respective Audit Committee of the Board. Apart from this, banks are also putting up a
detailed annual review of frauds to their Audit Committee of the Board.   The Board
for  Financial  Supervision  (BFS)  of  RBI  has  observed  that  in  terms  of  higher
governance  standards,  the  fraud  risk  management  and  fraud  investigation  must  be
‘owned’  by  the  bank’s  CEO,  Audit  Committee  of  the  Board  and  the  Special
Committee of the Board.

(b) Special Committee of the Board for monitoring large value frauds

Banks  are  required  to  constitute  a  special  committee  for  monitoring  and  follow  up  of
cases  of  frauds  involving  amounts  of  1  crore  and  above  exclusively,  while  the  Audit
Committee  of  the  Board  (ACB)  may  continue  to  monitor  all  the  cases  of  frauds  in
general.

Most retail cyber frauds and electronic banking frauds would be of values less than  1
crore and hence may not attract the necessary attention of the Special Committee of the
Board.  Since  these  frauds  are  large  in  number  and  have  the  potential  to  reach  large
proportions,  it  is  imperative  that  the  Special  Committee  of  the  Board  be  briefed
separately on this to keep them aware of the proportions of the fraud,  modus operandi
and  the  steps  taken  by  the  bank  to  mitigate  them.  The  Special  Committee  should
specifically monitor and review the progress of the mitigating steps taken by the bank in
case of electronic frauds and the efficacy of the same in containing fraud numbers and
values at least on a quarterly basis.

P a g e  | 113

(c)  Separate Department to manage frauds

The  activities  of  fraud  prevention,  monitoring,  investigation,  reporting  and  awareness
creation  should  be  owned  and  carried  out  by  an  independent  group  in  the  bank.  The
group should be adequately staffed and headed by a senior official of the Bank, not below
the rank of General Manager.

(d) Fraud review councils

Fraud  review  councils  should  be  set  up  by  the  above  fraud  risk  management  group  within
various business groups in the bank. The council should comprise of head of the business,
head  of  the  fraud  risk  management  department,  the  head  of  operations  supporting  that
particular business function and the head of information technology supporting that business
function. The councils should meet every quarter to review fraud trends and preventive steps
taken by the business group, and report the same to the Special Committee.

2. Components of fraud risk management:

(i)  Fraud prevention practices

A  strong  internal  control  framework  is  the  strongest  deterrence  for  frauds.  The  fraud  risk
management  department  along  with  the  business/operations/support  groups,  continuously
reviews various systems and controls, to remove gaps if any, and to strengthen the internal
control  framework.  The  following  are  some  of  the  fraud  prevention  practices  that  are
recommended for banks.

(a)  Fraud vulnerability assessments
Fraud vulnerability assessments should be undertaken across the bank by the fraud risk
management  group.  Apart  from  the  business  and  the  operations  groups,  such
assessment also cover channels of the bank such as branches, internet, ATM and phone
banking,  as  well  as  international  branches,  if  any.  During  the  course  of  a  vulnerability
assessment,  all  the  processes  should  be  assessed  based  on  their  fraud  risk.  Controls
need to be checked and improvements suggested for tightening the same. These should
be reviewed in the fraud review councils.

‘Mystery Shopping’ is an important constituent of vulnerability assessment. Transactions
are  introduced  in  ‘live’  scenarios  to  test  the  efficacy  of  controls.  The  results  of  the
mystery  shopping  exercises  should  be  shared  with  the  relevant  groups  in  the  fraud
review councils and be used for further strengthening of controls.

(b) Review of new products and processes
No  new  product  or  process  should  be  introduced  or  modified  in  a  bank  without  the
approval  of  control  groups  like  compliance,  audit  and  fraud  risk  management  groups.
The  product  or  process  needs  to  be  analysed  for  fraud  vulnerabilities  and    fraud  loss
limits to be mandated wherever vulnerabilities are noticed.

(c)  Fraud loss limits
All residual/open risks in products and processes need to be covered by setting ‘fraud-
loss'  limits.    'Fraud-loss'  limits  need  to  be  monitored  regularly  by  the  fraud  risk
management group and a review needs to be undertaken with the respective business
group when fraud loss amount reaches 90% of the limit set. In case it is difficult to set a
fraud- loss limit, a limit on the total number or total value of frauds may be defined. For
the purpose of deciding how much a product or a process has used up the limit set, the
cumulative value of frauds in that product or process during the financial year needs to
be considered.

P a g e  | 114

(d) Root cause analysis

All  actual  fraud  cases  above  10  lakhs  and  cases  where  a  unique  modus  operandi  is
involved,  should  be  reviewed  immediately  after  such  a  fraud  is  detected.  The  findings
should be used to redesign products and processes and remove the gaps so that they
do not recur.

for

incorporated  several  security  measures

(e)  Data/information/system security
Most  banks  have
their  documents,
information,  systems  and  customer  deliverables  such  as  cheque  books/debit  cards.
Security  measures  have  also  been  incorporated  during  delivery  of  instruments  such  as
cards/cheque books/internet passwords to customers through couriers.  Internet banking
systems  have  security  features  such  as  separate  transaction  passwords,  two  factor
authentication,  multi-channel  process  for  registering  payees,  upper  limit  on  transaction
value  and  SMS  alerts  to  customers.  It  is  also  necessary  that  customer  confidential
information  and  other  data/information  available  with  banks  is  secured  adequately  to
ensure that fraudsters do not access it to perpetrate fraudulent transactions. Appropriate
steps  need  to  be  taken  to  ensure  data/information/system  security  at  the  Bank,  as
indicated  earlier  in  the  report.  Information  security  and  appropriate  access  control
procedures ensure that only employees who are required to know particular information
have  access  to  the  same  and  can  put  through  transactions.  Further,  a  bank’s  systems
need to be  adequately secured to ensure that no un-authorised person carries out any
system  modifications/changes.  Appropriate  verification  procedures  should  also  be
incorporated  at  all  channels  such  as  phone  banking,  ATMs,  branches  and  internet  to
ensure that only genuine transactions are put through. All the above security measures
should be under continuous review for further strengthening.  Details in this regard were
covered in chapter on information security.

(f)  Know Your Customer (KYC) and know your employee/vendor procedures
A strong KYC process is the backbone of any fraud prevention activity. Such a process
enables  banks  to  prevent  unscrupulous  elements  from  gaining  entry  into  the  bank’s
environment,  which  gives  them  an  opportunity  to  carry  out  their  fraudulent  intentions.
Similarly,  appropriate  due  diligence  procedures  before  recruitment  of  employees  and
vendors  is  essential  to  prevent  known  fraudsters  or  people  with  fraudulent  motives  to
have access to a bank’s channels. Banks have to implement strong procedures to carry
out  due  diligence  of  potential  customers,  employees  and  vendors  before  they  are
enrolled.

(g) Physical security
All  banks  have  a  dedicated  team  to  take  care  of  the  security  of  the  physical
infrastructure.  This  team  should  conduct  regular  security  audits  of  various  offices  to
check  for  deviations/lapses.  It  is  the  responsibility  of  this  team  to  ensure  that  physical
assets  and  data  copied  on  magnetic/optical  media  do  not  go  out  of  the  offices  of  the
bank without authorisation.

(h) Creation of fraud awareness amongst staff and customers
Awareness  on  how  to  prevent  and  detect  frauds  is  the  basis  of  fraud  management.
Banks  need  to  adopt  various  measures  to  create  awareness  amongst  staff  and
customers.

(ii) Fraud detection

a)  Detection of fraud
Despite strong prevention controls aimed at fraud deterrence, fraudsters do manage to

P a g e  | 115

perpetrate frauds. In such cases, the earlier the fraud is detected, the better the chance
of recovery of the losses and bringing the culprits to book. System triggers that throw up
exceptional  transactions,  opening  up  channels  that  take  note  of  customer/employee
alerts/disputes,
encouraging
shopping
employees/customers/  well-  wishers  to  report  suspicious  transactions/behaviours  are
some of the techniques that are used for detection of frauds. The exceptional/suspicious
transactions/activities  reported  through  these  mechanisms  should  be  investigated  in
detail.

seeding/mystery

exercises

and

b)  Transaction monitoring
Banks  should  set  up  a  transaction  monitoring  unit  within  the  fraud  risk  management
group.  The  transaction  monitoring  team  should  be  responsible  for  monitoring  various
types of transactions, especially monitoring of potential fraud areas, by means of which,
early  alarms  can  be  triggered.  This  unit  needs  to  have  the  expertise  to  analyse
transactions  to  detect  fraud  trends.  This  unit  should  work  in  conjunction  with  the  data
warehousing  and  analytics  team  within  banks  for  data  extraction,  filtering,  and
sanitisation  for  transaction  analysis  for  determining  fraud  trends.  Banks  should  put  in
place  automated  systems  for  detection  of  frauds  based  on  advanced  statistical
algorithms and fraud detection techniques.

c)  Alert generation and redressal mechanisms
Appropriate  mechanisms  need  to  be  established  in  banks,  to  take  note  of  the
disputes/exceptions  or  suspicions  highlighted  by  various  stakeholders
including
transaction monitoring teams in banks and to investigate them thoroughly. Banks should
have a well publicised whistle blowing mechanism.

d)  Dedicated email ID and phone number for reporting suspected frauds
Banks  can  have  dedicated  email  IDs  and  phone  numbers  for  customers  to  report  any
fraudulent  activity  that  they  may  notice.  A  dedicated  team  can  be  created  to  reply  to
customer  queries  and  concerns  through  the  above  email  IDs.  Phone  banking  officers
and branch staff should also be trained on response to customers’ queries and concerns
on frauds.

e)  Mystery shopping and reviews
Continuous supervision and control by managers/supervisors on activities is important to
detect any abnormal activity. However, considering a bank’s size and scope, this needs
to  be  supplemented  by  mystery  shopping  to  detect  system  flaws  and  also  to  identify
unscrupulous employees/vendors. Immediate action needs to be taken on the findings of
such reviews.

Importance of early detection of frauds

f)
A bank’s fraud management function is effective if it is able to minimise frauds and when
fraud occurs, is able to detect the fraud so that the loss is minimised.

(iii) Fraud investigation

The  examination  of  a  suspected  fraud  or  an  exceptional  transaction  or  a  customer
dispute/alert in a bank shall be undertaken by:

•  Fraud risk management group
•  Specific committee/team of employees constituted to examine the ‘suspected

fraud’

•  External agencies, if any, as appointed by the bank

P a g e  | 116

a)  Fraud Investigation function
It is widely accepted that fraud investigation is a specialised function. Thus, the fraud risk
management  group  should  undergo  continuous  training  to  enhance  its  skills  and
competencies.  The  first  step  in  an  investigation  process  is  gathering  the  entire
transaction  details,  documents  and  complete  details  of  the  customer/employee  or
vendor.  In  order  to  investigate  into  suspected  cases,  the  group  would  adopt  various
advanced  techniques  including  computer  forensics,  forensic  accounting  and  tools  to
analyse large volumes of data.

The  investigation  team  may  conduct  oral  interviews  of  customers  or  employees  to
understand the  background  and  details  of  the case.  In case  an  interview  of  the  person
accused  of  fraud  is  required  to  be  undertaken,  the  investigation  group  should  follow  a
prescribed  procedure  and  record  statements  appropriately.    The  investigation  activities
need to be carried out discreetly and within a specified time line. The investigating team
should take into account all the relationships of the involved parties with the bank while
investigating and submitting an investigation report. The investigation report will help the
respective business groups take a decision on all the relationships of the customer with
the Bank. The investigation report should conclude whether a suspected case is a fraud
and  thereafter  the  report  would  form  the  basis  for  further  actions  such  as  regulatory
reporting.

In case of employee involvement in the fraud, the investigation report may be the basis
of  staff  accountability  and  HR  actions.  It  may  be  noted  that,  during  the  course  of  the
investigations, banks should adopt only means permitted by law, regulations and code of
conduct  of  the  bank  and  any  inconvenience  to  customers  or  general  public  should  be
avoided. It is also important to note that certain investigations are best carried out by law
enforcement  authorities  and  the  bank  should  refer  cases  to  such  authorities  at  the
appropriate time, to enable them to carry out their responsibilities efficiently.

In  case  of  need,  the  investigating  team  should  seek  the  support  of  other  specialised
groups within the bank, such as the audit group to carry out investigations efficiently.

At times, investigation of a fraud wherein money has come into the country to an account
in a bank through another bank in the same country needs to be done. The intermediary
bank  does  not  investigate  or  report  the  case  stating  that  it  is  merely  an  intermediary
while the recipient bank states that it has no knowledge of the transaction and is merely
a recipient of the funds sent by the intermediary bank. In this case, it is clarified that the
bank whose customer has received the money should investigate and report the case.

b)  Recovery of fraud losses
The  concerned  group  in  a  bank,  in  which  the  fraud  has  occurred,  should  make  all  out
efforts  to  recover  the  amount  lost.  They  may  use  specialised  groups  like  legal  or
collections  for  this  purpose.  The  investigation  team  may  also  be  able  to  recover  some
amounts  during  the  course  of  their  investigation.  The  Police  may  also  recover  some
amount  during  their  investigation.  This  would  be  deposited  in  Court  pending  final
adjudication. The bank should liaise with the Police and keep track of such amounts.

(iv) Reporting of frauds

As  per  the  guidelines  on  reporting  of  frauds  as  indicated  in  the  RBI  circular,  dated  July  1,
2010,  fraud  reports  should  be  submitted  in  all  cases  of  fraud  of  1  lakh  and  above
perpetrated  through  misrepresentation,  breach  of  trust,  manipulation  of  books  of  account,
fraudulent  encashment  of  instruments  like  cheques,  drafts  and  bills  of  exchange,
unauthorised  handling  of  securities  charged  to  the  bank,  misfeasance,  embezzlement,

P a g e  | 117

misappropriation  of  funds,  conversion  of  property,  cheating,  shortages,  irregularities,  etc.
Banks should also report frauds in the electronic channels and the variants of plastic cards
used by a bank and its customers for concluding financial transactions.

a)  Frauds in merchant acquiring business
 A  special  mention  needs  to  be  made  here  of  frauds  done  by  collusive  merchants  who
use  skimmed/stolen  cards  on  the  POS  terminals  given  to  them  by  banks  and  then
abscond  with  the  money  before  the  chargeback  is  received  on  the  transaction.  It  is
imperative  that  the  bank  which  has  provided  acquiring  services  to  such  merchant,
reports the case to RBI.

b)  Frauds in ATM acquiring business
Also, it has been observed that in a shared ATM network scenario, when the card of one
bank is used to perpetrate a fraud through another bank’s ATM, there is a lack of clarity
on  who  should  report  such  a  fraud.  It  is  the  bank  acquiring  the  transaction  that  should
report  the  fraud.  The  acquiring  bank  should  solicit  the  help  of  the  issuing  bank  in
recovery of the money. The facts of the case would decide as to which bank will bear the
loss.

c)  Filing of police complaints
Banks should readily share data and documents requested by the police even in cases
where  the  bank  in  question  is  not  the  victim  of  the  fraud  but  has  been  a  receiver  of
fraudulent monies into its accounts.

(v) Customer awareness on frauds

a)  Creation of customer awareness on frauds
Customer awareness is one of the pillars of fraud prevention. It has been seen that alert
customers have enabled prevention of several frauds and in case of frauds which could
not  be  avoided,  helped  in  bringing  the  culprit  to  book  by  raising  timely  alerts.  Banks
should thus aim at continuously educating its customers and solicit their participation in
various preventive/detective measures. It is the duty of all the groups in banks to create
fraud  risk  awareness  amongst  their  respective  customers.  The  fraud  risk  management
group  should  share  its  understanding  of  frauds  with  each  group,  identify  areas  where
customer  awareness  is  lacking  and  if  required,  guide  the  groups  on  programmes  to  be
run  for  creation  of  awareness  amongst  customers.  The  groups  should  ensure  that  in
each  of  their  interaction  with  customers  there  is  at  least  one  message  to  make  the
customer aware of fraud risk.

The  following  are  some  of  the  recommended  measures  to  create  awareness  amongst
customers:

•  Publications in leading newspapers
•  Detailed ‘do’s and don’ts’ on the web site of the bank
•  Messages along with statement of accounts, either physical or online
•  Messages  printed  on  bank’s  stationery  such  as  envelopes,  card

covers, etc.
•  SMS alerts
•  Message on phone banking when the customer calls
•  As inserts or on the jackets of cheque books
•  Posters in branches and ATM centres
Interstitials on television and radio
•

It  should  be  ensured  that  the  communication  to  the  customer  is  simple  and  aimed  at
making  them  aware  of  fraud  risks  and  seeking  their  involvement  in  taking  proper

P a g e  | 118

precautions  aimed  at  preventing  frauds.  Such  communication  should  be  reviewed
periodically by the fraud risk management group to judge its effectiveness.

(vi) Employee awareness and training

(a)  Creation of employee awareness
Employee  awareness  is  crucial  to  fraud  prevention.  Training  on  fraud  prevention
practices  should  be  provided  by  the  fraud  risk  management  group  at  various  forums.
Banks may use the following methods to create employee awareness:

•  Class  room  training  programmes  at  the  time  of  induction  or  during  risk

related training sessions

•  Publication  of  newsletters  on  frauds  covering  various  aspects  of  frauds
and  containing  important  message  on  fraud  prevention  from  senior
functionaries of the Bank

•  E-learning module on fraud prevention
•  Online games based on fraud risks in specific products or processes
•  E-tests on prevention practices and controls
•  Detailed ‘do’s and don’ts’  put up on the worksite of the employee
•  Safety tips flashed at the time of logging into Core Banking System (CBS),

screen savers, etc.

•  Emails sent by the respective business heads
•  Posters on various safety measures at the work place
•  Messages/discussions during daily work huddles

(b) Rewarding employees on fraud prevention
A positive way of creating employee awareness is to reward employees who have gone
beyond their call of duty, and prevented frauds. Awards may be given to employees who
have  done  exemplary  work  in  preventing  frauds.  Details  of  employees  receiving  such
awards may be published in the fraud newsletters.

CHAPTER 7: BUSINESS CONTINUITY PLANNING

Introduction

individual

The  pivotal  role  that  banking  sector  plays  in  the  economic  growth  and  stability,  both  at
national  and
Increased
contribution  of  24x7  electronic  banking  channels  has  increased  the  demand  to  formulate
consolidated  Business  Continuity  Planning  (BCP)  guidelines  covering  critical  aspects  of
people, process and technology.

level,  requires  continuous  and  reliable  services.

BCP forms a part of an organisation's overall Business Continuity Management (BCM) plan,
which  is  the  “preparedness  of  an  organisation”,  which  includes  policies,  standards  and
procedures to ensure continuity, resumption and recovery of critical business processes, at
an agreed level and limit the impact of the disaster on people, processes and infrastructure
(includes IT); or to minimise the operational, financial, legal, reputational and other material
consequences arising from such a disaster.

Effective business continuity management typically incorporates business impact analyses,
recovery  strategies  and  business  continuity  plans,  as  well  as  a  governance  programme
covering  a  testing  programme,  training  and  awareness  programme,  communication  and
crisis management programme.

1. Roles, Responsibilities and Organisational structure

Board of Directors and Senior Management

A bank’s Board has the ultimate responsibility and oversight over BCP activity of a bank. The
Board  approves  the  Business  Continuity  Policy  of  a  bank.  Senior  Management  is
responsible for overseeing the BCP process which includes:

•  Determining how the institution will manage and control identified risks
•  Allocating  knowledgeable  personnel  and  sufficient  financial  resources  to  implement  the

BCP

•  Prioritizing critical business functions
•  Designating  a  BCP  committee  who  will  be  responsible  for  the  Business  Continuity

Management

•  The top management should annually review the adequacy of the institution's business
recovery, contingency plans and the test results and put up the same to the Board.
•  The top management should consider evaluating the adequacy of contingency planning
and  their  periodic  testing  by  service  providers  whenever  critical  operations  are
outsourced.

•  Ensuring that the BCP is independently reviewed and approved at least annually;
•  Ensuring  employees  are  trained  and  aware  of  their  roles  in  the  implementation  of  the

BCP

•  Ensuring the BCP is regularly tested on an enterprise-wide basis
•  Reviewing the BCP testing programme and test results on a regular basis and
•  Ensuring the BCP is continually updated to reflect the current operating environment

1.1 BCP Head or Business Continuity Coordinator

A senior official needs to be designated as the Head of BCP activity or function.

His or her responsibilities include:

−  Developing  of  an  enterprise-wide  BCP  and  prioritisation  of  business  objectives  and

critical operations that are essential for recovery

−  Business  continuity  planning  to  include  the  recovery,  resumption,  and  maintenance

of all aspects of the business, not just recovery of the technology components;

−  Considering the integration of the institution’s role in financial markets;
−  Regularly  updating  business  continuity  plans  based  on  changes  in  business

processes, audit recommendations, and lessons learned from testing

−  Following  a  cyclical,  process-oriented  approach  that  includes  a  business  impact

analysis (BIA), a risk assessment, management and monitoring and testing
 Considering all factors and deciding upon declaring a “crisis”

−

1.2 BCP Committee or Crisis Management Team

Since  electronic  banking  has  functions  spread  across  more  than  one  department,  it  is
necessary  that  each  department  understands  its  role  in  the  plan.  It  is  also  important  that
each  gives  its  support  to  maintain  it.  In  case  of  a  disaster,  each  has  to  be  prepared  for  a
recovery process, aimed at protection of critical functions. To this end, it would be helpful if a
set up like the BCP Committee, charged with the implementation of BCP, in an eventuality
and all departments expected to fulfill their respective roles in a coordinated manner.

Hence,  a  committee  consisting  of  senior  officials  from  departments  like  HR,  IT,  Legal,
Business and Information Security needs to be instituted with the following broad mandate:

−
−
−

 To exercise, maintain and to invoke business continuity plan, as needed
 Communicate, train and promote awareness
 Ensure  that  the  Business  Continuity  Plan  (BCP)  fits  with  other  plans  and
requirement of concerned authorities
 Budgetary issues
 Ensure training and awareness on BCP to concerned teams and employees

−
−
−  Co-ordinating  the  activities  of  other  recovery,  continuity,  response  teams  and

handling key decision-making

−  They determine the activation of the BCP
−  Other functions entail handling legal matters evolving from the disaster, and handling

public relations and media inquiries

1.3 BCP Teams

There needs to be adequate teams for various aspects of BCP at  central office, as well as
individual controlling offices or at a branch level, as required. Among the teams that can be
considered  based  on  need,  are  the  incident  response  team,  emergency  action  and
operations  team,  team  from  particular  business  functions,  damage  assessment  team,  IT
teams for hardware, software, network support, supplies team, team for organizing logistics,
relocation  team,  administrative  support  team,  coordination  team.  Illustrative  guidelines  for
committees or teams for BCP are provided in Annex C.

2. Critical Components of Business Continuity Management Framework

The BCP requirements enunciated in this document should be considered. The onus lies on
the Board and Senior Management for generating detailed components of BCP in the light of
an individual bank's activities, systems and processes.

2.1 BCP Methodology

Banks  should  consider  looking  at  BCP  methodologies  and  standards–BS  25999  by  BSI–
which follows the “Plan-Do-Check-Act Principle”.

BCP methodology should include:

Phase 1: Business Impact Analysis

−

Identification  of  critical  businesses,  owned  and  shared  resources  with  supporting
functions to come up with the Business Impact Analysis (BIA)

−  Formulating Recovery Time Objectives (RTO), based on BIA. It may also be periodically

fine-tuned by benchmarking against industry best practices

−  Critical  and  tough  assumptions  in  terms  of  disaster,  so  that  the  framework  would  be

−

exhaustive enough to address most stressful situations
Identification of the Recovery Point Objective (RPO), for data loss for each of the critical
systems and strategy to deal with such data loss

−  Alternate procedures during the time systems are not available and estimating resource

requirements

Phase 2: Risk Assessment

−  Structured  risk  assessment  based  on  comprehensive  business  impact  analysis.  This
assessment  considers  all  business  processes  and  is  not  limited  to  the  information
processing facilities.

−  Risk management by implementing appropriate strategy/ architecture to attain the bank’s

agreed RTOs and RPOs.

v)  Impact  on  restoring  critical  business  functions,  including  customer-facing  systems  and
payment and settlement systems such as cash disbursements, ATMs, internet banking,
or call centres

•  Dependency and risk involved in use of external resources and support

Phase 3: Determining Choices and Business Continuity Strategy

•  BCP  should  evolve  beyond  the  information  technology  realm  and  must  also  cover
people, processes and infrastructure
•  The methodology should prove for the safety and well-being of people in the branch /
outside location at the time of the disaster.
•  Define response actions based on identified classes of disaster.
•  To  arrive  at  the  selected  process  resumption  plan,  one  must  consider  the  risk
acceptance for the bank, industry and applicable regulations

Phase 4: Developing and Implementing BCP

P a g e  | 122

•  Action  plans,  i.e.:  defined  response  actions  specific  to  the  bank’s  processes  ,  practical
manuals(  do  and  don’ts,  specific  paragraph’s  customised  to  individual  business  units)
and testing procedures

•  Establishing management succession and emergency powers
•  Compatibility  and  co-ordination  of  contingency  plans  at  both  the  bank  and  its  service

providers

•  The  recovery  procedure  should  not  compromise  on  the  control  environment  at  the

recovery location

•  Having  specific  contingency  plans  for  each  outsourcing  arrangement  based  on  the

degree of materiality of the outsourced activity to the bank's business

•  Periodic updating to absorb changes in the institution or its service providers. Examples
of  situations  that  might  necessitate  updating  the  plans  include  acquisition  of  new
equipment, upgradation of the operational systems and changes in:

a) Personnel
b) Addresses or telephone numbers
c) Business strategy
d) Location, facilities and resources
e) Legislation
f) Contractors, suppliers and key customers
g) Processes–new or withdrawn ones
h) Risk (operational and financial)

2.3 Key Factors to be considered for BCP Design

Following factors should be considered while designing the BCP:

•  Probability  of  unplanned  events,

including  natural  or  man-made  disasters,

earthquakes, fire, hurricanes or bio-chemical disaster

•  Security threats
•  Increasing infrastructure and application interdependencies
•  Regulatory and compliance requirements, which are growing increasingly complex
•  Failure of key third party arrangements
•  Globalisation and the challenges of operating in multiple countries.

1.4 BCP Considerations

(a)  Banks  must  consider  implementing  a  BCP  process  to  reduce  the  impact  of
disruption, caused by disasters and security failures to an acceptable level through a
combination of preventive and recovery measures.

(b)  BCP  should  include  measures  to  identify  and  reduce  probability  of  risk  to  limit  the
consequences of damaging incidents and enable the timely resumption of essential
operations.  BCP  should  amongst  others,  consider  reputation,  operational,  financial,
regulatory risks.

(c)  The  failure  of  critical  systems  or  the  interruption  of  vital  business  processes  could
prevent  timely  recovery  of  operations.  Therefore,  financial  institution  management
must  fully  understand  the  vulnerabilities  associated  with  interrelationships  between
various systems, departments, and business processes. These vulnerabilities should
be  incorporated  into  the  BIA,  which  analyses  the  correlation  between  system
components and the services they provide.

(d)  Various  tools  can  be  used  to  analyse  these  critical  interdependencies,  such  as  a
work  flow  analysis,  an  organisational  chart,  a  network  topology,  and  inventory
records.  A  work  flow  analysis  can  be  performed  by  observing  daily  operations  and

P a g e  | 123

interviewing employees to determine what resources and services are shared among
various  departments.  This  analysis,  in  conjunction  with  the  other  tools,  will  allow
management
to  understand  various  processing  priorities,  documentation
requirements,  and  the  interrelationships  between  various  systems.  The  following
issues when determining critical interdependencies within the organisation:

i.  Key personnel;
ii.   Vital records;
iii.   Shared equipment, hardware, software, data files, and workspace;
iv.   Production processes;
v.   Customer services;
vi.   Network connectivity; and
vii.   Management information systems.

(e)  Key Considerations while Formulating A BCP:

-  Ensuring  prompt  and  accurate  processing  of  securities

transactions,
including, but not limited to, order taking, order entry, execution, comparison,
allocation,  clearance  and  settlement  of  securities
the
maintenance  of  customer  accounts,  access  to  customer  accounts  and  the
delivery of funds and securities.

transactions,

-  Honouring of all customer payouts (i.e. obligation)
-  Providing priority to intra-day deal payment
-  Providing customers prompt access to their funds and securities – measures
should  be  undertaken  to  make  customer  funds  and  securities  available  to
customers in the event of a significant business disruption.

-  Continuing compliance with regulatory reporting requirements etc.

(f)  A  single  framework  of  BCP  should  be  maintained  to  ensure  that  all  plans  are
consistent, and to identify priorities and dependencies for testing and maintenance.

A BCP framework should consider the following:

•  Conditions  for  activating  plans,  which  describe  a  process  to  be  followed  (how  to

assess the situation, who is to be involved, etc.) before each plan is activated

•

•  Emergency procedures, which describe the actions to be taken following an incident
which  jeopardises  business  operations  and/  or  human  life.  This  should  include
arrangements  for  public  relations  management  and  for  effective  liaison  with
appropriate public authorities e.g. police, fire service, health-care services and local
government
Identification  of  the  processing  resources  and  locations,  available  to  replace  those
supporting  critical  activities;  fall  back  procedures  which  describe  the  actions  to  be
taken  to  move  essential  business  activities  or  support  services  to  alternative
temporary  locations  and  to  bring  business  processes  back  into  operation  in  the
required time-scales
Identification of information to be backed up and the location for storage, as well as
the  requirement  for  the  information  to  be  saved  for  back-up  purpose  on  a  stated
schedule and compliance therewith

•

•  Resumption procedures, which describe the actions to be taken to return to normal

business operations

•  A maintenance schedule which specifies how and when the plan will be tested and

the process for maintaining the plan

•  Awareness  and  education  activities,  which  are  designed  to  create  understanding  of
critical banking operations and functions, business continuity processes and ensure

P a g e  | 124

that the processes continue to be effective

•  The  responsibilities  of  the  individuals,  describing  who  is  responsible  for  executing

which component of the plan. Alternatives should be nominated as required.

(g) Pandemic Planning

Pandemics  are  defined  as  epidemics,  or  outbreaks  in  humans,  of  infectious  diseases  that
have  the  ability  to  spread  rapidly  over  large  areas,  possibly  worldwide.  Adverse  economic
effects  of  a  pandemic  could  be  significant,  both  nationally  and  internationally.  Due  to  their
crucial  financial  and  economic  role,  financial  institutions  should  have  plans  in  place  that
describe how they will manage through a pandemic event.

Pandemic  planning  presents  unique  challenges  to  financial  institution  management.  Unlike
natural  disasters,  technical  disasters,  malicious  acts,  or  terrorist  events,  the  impact  of  a
pandemic is much more difficult to determine because of the anticipated difference in scale
and duration. Further, while traditional disasters and disruptions normally have limited time
durations,  pandemics  generally  occur  in  multiple  waves,  each  lasting  two  to  three  months.
Consequently, no individual or organisation is safe from the adverse effects that might result
from a pandemic event.

One of the most significant challenges likely from a severe pandemic event will be staffing
shortages  due  to  absenteeism.  These  differences  and  challenges  highlight  the  need  for  all
financial institutions, no matter their size, to plan for a pandemic event when developing their
BCP.

It  is  important  for  institutions  to  actively  keep  abreast  of  international  and  national
developments and health advisories issued in this regard.

Accordingly, a bank’s BCP needs to provide for the following:

1. A preventive programme to reduce the likelihood that a bank’s operations will be
significantly  affected  by  a  pandemic  event,  including:  monitoring  of  potential
outbreaks,  educating  employees,  communicating  and  coordinating  with  critical
service providers and suppliers, in addition to providing appropriate hygiene training
and tools to employees.

2. A documented strategy that provides for scaling the institution’s pandemic efforts
so they are consistent with the effects of a particular stage of a pandemic outbreak,
such as first cases of humans contracting the disease overseas or in India and first
cases within the organisation itself. The strategy will also need to outline plans that
state  how  to  recover  from  a  pandemic  wave  and  proper  preparations  for  any
following wave(s).

3. A comprehensive framework of facilities, systems, or procedures that provide the
organisation  the  capability  to  continue  its  critical  operations  in  the  event  that  large
numbers  of  the  institution’s  staff  are  unavailable  for  prolonged  periods.  Such
procedures could include social distancing to minimise staff contact, telecommuting,
redirecting  customers  from  branch  to  electronic  banking  services,  or  conducting
operations from alternative sites.

4. The framework should consider the impact of customer reactions and the potential
demand  for,  and  increased  reliance  on,  online  banking,  telephone  banking,  ATMs,
and  call  support  services.  In  addition,  consideration  should  be  given  to  possible
actions  by  public  health  and  other  government  authorities  that  may  affect  critical
business functions of a financial institution.

P a g e  | 125

5.  A  testing  programme  to  ensure  that  the  institution’s  pandemic  planning  practices
and capabilities are effective and will allow critical operations to continue.

6. An oversight programme to ensure ongoing review and updates to the pandemic
plan  so  that  policies,  standards,  and  procedures  include  up-to-date,  relevant
information  provided  by  governmental  sources  or  by  the  institution’s  monitoring
programme.

7. Banks may also consider insurance to transfer risk to a third party, however taking
due care regarding certainty of payments in the event of disruptions.

3. Testing A BCP

– Banks must regularly test BCP to ensure that they are up to date and effective: Testing of
BCP  should  include  all  aspects  and  constituents  of  a  bank  i.e.  people,  processes  and
resources  (including  technology).  BCP,  after  full  or  partial  testing  may  fail.  Reasons  are
incorrect assumptions, oversights or changes in equipment or personnel. BCP tests should
ensure  that  all  members  of  the  recovery  team  and  other  relevant  staff  are  aware  of  the
plans. The test schedule for BCPs should indicate how and when each component of a plan
is  to  be  tested.  It  is  recommended  to  test  the  individual  components  of  the  plans(s)
frequently, typically at a minimum of once a year. A variety of techniques should be used in
order to provide assurance that the plan(s) will operate in real life.

–  Banks  should  involve  their  Internal  Auditors  (including  IS  Auditors)  to  audit  the
effectiveness  of  BCP:  And  its  periodic  testing  as  part  of  their  Internal  Audit  work  and  their
findings/ recommendations in this regard should be incorporated in their report to the Board
of Directors.

–  Banks  should  consider  having  a  BCP  drill  planned  along  with  the  critical  third  parties:  In
order  to  provide  services  and  support  to  continue  with  pre-identified  minimal  required
processes.

–  Banks  should  also  periodically  moving  their  operations:  Including  people,  processes  and
resources  (IT  and  non-IT)  to  the  planned  fall-over  or  DR  site  in  order  to  test  the  BCP
effectiveness  and  also  gauge  the  recovery  time  needed  to  bring  operations  to  normal
functioning.

– Banks should consider performing the above test without movement of bank personnel to
the DR site. This will help in testing the readiness of alternative staff at the DR site.

– Banks should consider having unplanned BCP drill: Wherein only a restricted set of people
and  certain  identified  personnel  may  be  aware  of  the  drill  and  not  the  floor  or  business
personnel. In such cases banks should have a “Lookout Team” deployed at the location to
study and assimilate the responses and needs of different teams. Based on the outcome of
this study, banks should revise their BCP Plan to suit the ground requirements.

3.1 Testing Techniques

The below are few of the illustrative techniques that can be used for BCP testing purposes:

•  Table-top  testing  for  scenarios  (discussing  business  recovery  arrangements  using

example interruptions)
•  Simulations  (particularly

for

training  people

in

their  post-incident  or  crisis

P a g e  | 126

management roles)

•  Technical  recovery  testing  (ensuring  information  systems  can  be  restored

effectively)

•  Testing recovery at an alternate site (running business processes in parallel with

recovery operations away from the main site)

•  Tests of supplier facilities and services (ensuring externally provided services and

products will meet the contracted commitment)

•  Complete rehearsals (testing that the organisation, personnel, equipment, facilities

and processes can cope with interruptions)

a)  Simulation  testing:  It  is  when  participants  choose  a  specific  scenario  and  simulate  an
on-location BCP situation. It involves testing of all resources: people, IT and others, who are
required  to  enable  the  business  continuity  for  a  chosen  scenario.  The  focus  is  on
demonstration  of  capability,  including  knowledge,  team  interaction  and  decision-making
capabilities.  It  can  also  specify  role  playing  with  simulated  response  at  alternate
locations/facilities to act out critical steps, recognise difficulties, and resolve problems.

b)  Component  testing:  This  is  to  validate  the  functioning  of  an  individual  part  or  a  sub-
process of a process, in the event of BCP invocation. It focuses on concentrating on in-depth
testing  of  the  part  or  sub-process  to  identify  and  prepare  for  any  risk  that  may  hamper  its
smooth running. For example, testing of ATM switch.

Each organisation must define frequency, schedule and clusters of Business Areas, selected
for test after a through Risk and Business Impact Analysis has been done.

The  bank  can  consider  broad  guidelines  provided  below  for  determining  the  testing
frequency based on critical of a process:

4. Maintenance and Re-assessment of Plans

(a)  BCPs should be maintained by annual reviews and updates to ensure their continued
effectiveness.  Procedures  should  be  included  within  the  organisation’s  change
management programme to ensure that business continuity matters are appropriately
addressed.  Responsibility  should  be  assigned  for  regular  reviews  of  each  business
continuity  plan.  The  identification  of  changes  in  business  arrangements/processes,
not  yet  reflected  in  the  business  continuity  plans,  should  be  followed  by  an
appropriate update of the plan on a periodic basis, say quarterly. This would require
a process of conveying any changes to the institution’s business, structure, systems,
software, hardware, personnel, or facilities to the BCP coordinator/team. If significant

P a g e  | 127

changes  have  occurred  in  the  business  environment,  or  if  audit  findings  warrant
changes to the BCP or test programme, the business continuity policy guidelines and
programme requirements should be updated accordingly.

(b)  Changes  should  follow  the  bank’s  formal  change  management  process  in  place  for
its policy or procedure documents. This formal change control process should ensure
that  the  updated  plans  are  distributed  and  reinforced  by  regular  reviews  of  the
complete plan.

(c)  A copy of the BCP, approved by the Board, should be forwarded for  perusal to the

RBI on an annual basis. In addition, the bank should also submit:

–  An  annual  statement  at  the  end  of  each  financial  year  describing  the  critical
systems, their Rots and the bank’s strategy to achieve them, and

– A quarterly statement, reporting major failures during the period for critical systems,
customer segment or services impacted due to the failures and steps taken to avoid
such failures in future.

5. Procedural aspects of BCP

(a)  An effective BCP should take into account the potential of wide area disasters, which
impact an entire region, and for resulting loss or inaccessibility of staff. It should also
consider  and  address  inter  dependencies,  both  market-based  and  geographic,
among financial system participants as well as infrastructure service providers.

(b)  Further, banks should also consider the need to put in place necessary backup sites
for their critical payment systems which interact with the systems at the Data centres
of the Reserve Bank.

(c)  Banks  may  also  consider  running  some  critical  processes  and  business  operations
from  primary  and  the  secondary  sites,  wherein  each  would  provide  back-up  to  the
other.

(d)  Namely  prioritising  process  and  alternative  location  for  personnel  in  the  following

categories:

•  Dealers and traders
•  Operations (e.g. teller, loan desk, cash desk etc.)
•  Treasury department staff
•  Sales staff
•
IT staff
•  Corporate functions (HR, Admin) staff
•  Comprehensive testing would help banks to further fine-tune BCP/DR processes
to ensure their robustness and also enable smooth switch-over to the DR site, as
per the priority and scale of processes identified for each process.

(e)  All critical processes should be documented to reduce dependency on personnel for

scenarios where the staff is not able to reach the designated office premises.

(f)  Backup/standby  personnel  should  be  identified  for  all  critical  roles.  A  call  matrix
should be developed to better co-ordinate future emergency calls involving individual
financial  authorities,  financial  sector  trade  associations,  and  other  banks  and
stakeholders.  In  addition  the  organisation  should  have  calling  tree  with  branches

P a g e  | 128

across specific region/business processes. Based on the nature of the emergency a
particular branch/the entire calling tree should be activated.

(g)  The  relevant  portion  of  the  BCP  adopted  should  also  be  disseminated  to  all
concerned,  including  the  customers,  so  that  the  awareness  would  enable  them  to
react  positively  and  in  consonance  with  the  BCP.  This  would  help  maintain  the
customer’s faith on the banking institution, and the possibility of a bank-run would be
exponentially  minimised.  The  part  of  the  plan  kept  in  the  public  domain  should
normally be confined to information relating to the general readiness of the banks in
this  regard  without  any  detailed  specifics,  to  protect  the  banks  from  becoming
vulnerable to security threats

(h)  Banks should consider formulating a clear ‘Communication Strategy’ with the help of
media  management  personnel  to  control  the  content  and  form  of  news  being
percolated to their customers in times of panic.

(i)  Banks should consider having a detailed BCP plan for encountering natural calamity/
disaster situation. A formal exception policy should be documented which will guide
the affected areas Personnel to act independently till connection to the outside world
is resumed.

(j)  The  above  mentioned  guideline  should  have  exceptions  documented  for  critical
process  which  will  ensure  continuation  of  critical  process  without  the  regular
operational formalities.

(k)  After  appropriate  approvals  or  permissions  are  obtained  internally  and  from  RBI,
banks  should  consider  having  a  guideline  ready  on  relaxing  certain  rules/
requirements for customers affected by the calamity.

(l)  Like:

•  Extending loan/interest payment timeliness
•
Issuance of fresh loan with minimal required documents
•  Waving off late payment fees and penalties in certain cases
•  Allowing more than normal cash withdrawal from ATM’s

(m) Banks  can  consider  expediting  cheque  clearing  for  customers  by  directing  all
cheques to a different region than the one affected by the calamity. In case of severe
calamity banks should consider restricting existing loans to facilitate rebuilding efforts
by the Govt. for the calamity areas. The banks may also be consider ensuring quick
processing  of  loan  applications,  preferably  within  48  hours  of  receipt  of  such
applications.  It  should  consider  dispatching  credit  bill,  agreement  notes,  etc.  due  to
customer by having an arrangement to print the same at an alternative location and
should  consider  accepting  late  payments  for  credit  card  dues  for  customers  in  the
calamity affected area.

(n)  Banks may also endeavor for resumption of banking services by setting up satellite

offices, extension counters or mobile banking facilities.

6. Infrastructure Aspects of BCP

–  Banks  should  consider  paying  special  attention  to  availability  of  basic  amenities  such  as
electricity, water and first-aid box in all offices. (e.g. evaluate the need of electricity backup
not just for its systems but also for its people and running the infrastructure like central air-
conditioning.)

P a g e  | 129

–  Banks  should  consider  assigning  ownership  for  each  area.  Emergency  procedures,
manual fallback plans and resumption plans should be within the responsibility of the owners
of the appropriate business resources or processes involved.

– In-house telecommunications systems and wireless transmitters on buildings should have
backup  power.  Redundant  systems,  such  as  analogue  line  phones  and  satellite  phones
(where  appropriate),  and  other  simple  measures,  such  as  ensuring  the  availability  of  extra
batteries for mobile phones, may prove essential to maintaining communications in a wide-
scale infrastructure failure.

–  Possible  fallback  arrangements  should  be considered  and  alternative  services should  be
carried  out  in  co-ordination  with  the  service  providers,  contractors,  suppliers  under  written
agreement  or  contract,  setting  out  roles  and  responsibilities  of  each  party,  for  meeting
emergencies.  Also,  imposition  of  penalties,  including  legal  action,  may  be  initiated  by  an
organisation  against  service  providers  or  contractors  or  suppliers,  in  the  event  of
noncompliance or non-co-operation.

identified,  established  emergency  procedures:  e.g.
–  When  new  requirements  are
evacuation plans or any existing fallback arrangements, should be amended as appropriate.

– Banks may consider having backup resources (erg. stationery required for cheque printing,
special printers, stamps) at a secondary operational location.

–  The plans may also suitably be aligned with those of the local government authorities

– Banks should consider not storing critical papers, files, servers in the ground floors where
there is possibility of floods or water logging. However, banks should also consider avoiding
top floors in taller building to reduce impact due to probable fire.

– Fire-proof and water-proof storage areas must be considered for critical documents.

–  Banks  should  consider  having  alternative  means  of  power  source  (like  procurement  of
more diesel/ emergency battery backup etc.) for extended period of power cuts.

–  Banks  should  consider  having  an  emergency  helpline  number  or  nationalised  IVR
message to resolve queries of customers and ensure that panic situation is avoided. For this
an  alternative  backup  area  call  centre  should  be  identified  to  take  over  part  load  of  the
calamity  affected  area.  Designated  person/  team  must  be  responsible  for  enabling  line
diversion.  A  similar  service  can  also  be  considered  for  the  benefit  of  employee  related
communication.

7. Human Aspects of BCP

People are a vital component of any organisation. They should therefore be an integral part
of  a  BCP.  Generally,  plans  are  often  too  focused  on  the  technical  issues,  therefore,  it  is
suggested  that  a  separate  section  relating  to  people  should  be  incorporated,  including
details  on  staff  welfare,  counseling,  relocation  considerations,  etc.  BCP  awareness
programmer  should  also  be  implemented  which  serve  to  strengthen  staff  involvement  in
BCP.  This  can  be  done  through  induction  programme  newsletters,  staff  training  exercises,
etc.

Banks  must  consider  training  more  than  one  individual  staff  for  specific  critical  jobs  (ire.  in
the absence on one employee the work must not be stalled or delayed). They must consider
cross-training  employees  for  critical  functions  and  document-operating  procedures.  Banks

P a g e  | 130

should  consider  possibility  of  enabling  work-from--home  capabilities  and  resources  for
employees performing critical functions.

Role of HR in the BCP context

a)  Crisis  Management  Team:  As  a  core  member  of  the  CMT,  HR  provides  guidance  to
team  on  people-related  issues,  including  evacuation,  welfare,  whether  to  invoke  the  HR
incident line, alternative travel arrangements and what to communicate to staff.

b) HR Incident Line: Operated from within the centralised HR function, the incident helpline
is  invoked  in  those  instances,  where  there  are  possible  casualties  or  missing  staff,  as  a
result of an incident. Invoked by the CMT, the line is manned by qualified HR officers trained
in how to deal with distressed callers. The staff may be provided with an emergency card,
which includes the incident line number. Information on the hotline is updated on a regular
basis. The facility enables line managers to keep the central crisis team up to speed on the
whereabouts and well-being of staff. Ongoing welfare and support for staff is also provided
via an employee assistance provider.

c)  Exceptional  Travel  arrangements:  Transportation  plans  should  be  considered  in  the
event of the need to relocate. Key staff needs to be identified including details of where they
are located, and vehicles are on standby to transport them if required.

8. Technology Aspects of BCP

The are many applications and services in banking system that are highly mission critical in
nature  and  therefore  requires  high  availability,  and  fault  tolerance  to  be  considered  while
designing and implementing the solution. This aspect is to be taken into account especially
while designing the data centre solution and the corporate network solution.

Data Recovery Strategies

Prior  to  selecting  a  data  recovery  (DR)  strategy,  a  DR  planner  should  refer  to  their
organisation's  BCP,  which  should  indicate  key  metrics  of  recovery  point  objective  and
recovery time objective for business processes:

Recovery Point Objective (RPO)–The acceptable latency of data that will be recovered

Recovery Time Objective (RTO)–The acceptable amount of time to restore the function

Recovery  Point  Objective  must  ensure  that  the  Maximum  Tolerable  Data  Loss  for  each
activity  is  not  exceeded.  The  Recovery  Time  Objective  must  ensure  that  the  Maximum
Tolerable  Period  of  Disruption  (MTPD),  for  each  activity,  is  not  exceeded.  The  metrics
specified for the business processes must then be mapped to the underlying IT systems and
infrastructure  that  support  those  processes.  Once,  RTO  and  RPO  metrics  have  been
mapped  to  the  IT  infrastructure,  the  DR  planner  can  determine  the  most  suitable  recovery
strategy  for  each  system.  An  important  note  here,  however,  is  that  the  business  ultimately
sets  the  IT  budget.  Therefore,  RTO  and  RPO  metrics  need  to  fit  with  the  available  budget
and the critical of the business process/function.

A List of Common Strategies for Data Protection:

−  Backups made to tape and sent off-site at regular intervals (preferably daily)

−  Backups made to disk on-site and automatically copied to off-site disk, or made

directly to off-site disk

−  Replication of data to an off-site location, which overcomes the need to restore the
data (only the systems then need to be restored or synced). This generally makes

P a g e  | 131

use of storage area network (SAN) technology

−  High availability systems that keep both data and system replicated, off-site, enabling

continuous access to systems and data

In many cases, an organisation may elect to use an outsourced disaster recovery provider to
provide a stand-by site and systems rather than using their own remote facilities. In addition
to  preparing  for  the  need  to  recover  systems,  organisations  must  also  implement
precautionary  measures  with  an  objective  of  preventing  a  disaster  in  the  first  place.  These
may include some of the following:

−  Local mirrors of systems or data. Use of disk protection technology such as RAID

−  Surge protectors—to minimise the effect of power surges on delicate electronic

equipment

−  Uninterrupted power supply (UPS) or backup generator to keep systems going in the

event of a power failure

−  Fire preventions—alarms, fire extinguishers

−  Anti-virus software and security measures

A disaster recovery plan is a part of the BCP. It dictates every facet of the recovery process,
including:

−  What events denote possible disasters;

−  What people in the organisation have the authority to declare a disaster and

thereby put the plan into effect;

−  The sequence of events necessary to prepare the backup site once a disaster

has been declared;

−  The roles and responsibilities of all key personnel with respect to carrying out the

plan;

−  An inventory of the necessary hardware and software required to restore

production;

−  A schedule listing the personnel that will be staffing the backup site, including a
rotation schedule to support ongoing operations without burning out the disaster
team members.

A  disaster  recovery  plan  must  be  a  living  document;  as  the  data  centre  changes,  the  plan
must be updated to reflect those changes.

It is to be noted that the technology issues are a derivative of the Business Continuity plan
and Management.

For  example,  BCP  and  Management  will  lead  to  the  Business  Impact  Analysis,  which  will
lead  to  the  Performance  Impact  Analysis  (PIA).  That  will  depend  on  the  Technology
Performance of the total IT Solution Architecture.

To  amplify  business  impact  analysis  is  to  identify  the  critical  operations  and  services,  key
internal  and  external  dependencies  and  appropriate  resilience  levels.  It  also  analysis  the
risks and quantify the impact of those risks from the point of view of the business disruptions.
For example, in order to provide state of the art customer services both at the branch level
and  the  delivery  channels  we  need  to  take  into  account  the  services  levels  that  are
committed.

P a g e  | 132

If an ATM transaction has to take place in 10 seconds and cash withdrawal or deposit has to
take  place  in  60  seconds  at  the  counter,  then  based  on  the  load  one  can  compute  the
number of customers who can be serviced in a day. The above example is to understand the
fact  that  the  business  latency  introduced  by  the  system  is  a  combination  of  technology,
process  and  people.  Therefore,  the  technical  latency  is  a  derivative  of  the  committed
business  latency  and  the  technology  solution  architecture  has  to  deliver  the  same  under
varying loads.

Technology Solution Architecture to address specific BCM requirements are:

•  Performance

•  Availability

•  Security and Access Control

•  Conformance to standards to ensure Interoperability

Performance of the technology solution architecture for operations needs to be quantified. It
should  be  possible  to  measure,  as  and  when  required,  the  quantified  parameters.  (For
example, if the latency for a complex transaction initiated at the branch has to be completed
in  four  seconds  under  peak  load,  it  should  be  possible  to  have  adequate  measuring
environments  to  ensure  that  performance  degradations  have  not  taken  place  due  to
increasing loads.)

Solution architecture has to be designed with high-availability, and no single point of failure.
It is inevitable that a complex solution architecture with point products from different sources
procured and implemented at different points in time will have some outage once in a while
and the important issue is that with clearly defined SLAs, mean time to restore, it should be
possible to identify the fault and correct the same without any degradation in performance.

Accordingly,  with  respect  to  the  performance  and  availability  aspects  the  following
architectures have to be designed and configured to provide high levels of up time round the
clock to ensure uninterrupted functioning.

Summation of the required processes:

–Data centre solution architecture

–DR solution architecture

–Near site solution architecture

–Enterprise network and security architecture

– Branch or delivery channel architecture

–  Based  on  the  above  observation,  banks  are  required  to  do  the  following:  Take  up  the
performance and availability audit of the solutions deployed to ensure that the architecture is
designed and implemented with no single point of failure.

–  Audit  the  deployed  architecture  for  all  the  mission  critical  applications  and  services  and
resolve the concerns that arise in a time bound manner.

– Periodically investigate the outages that are experienced from time to time, which are mini
disasters  that  result  in  non  availability  of  services  for  a  short  span  of  time,  systems  not
responding  when  transactions  are  initiated  at  the  branch  level,  delivery  channels  not
functioning for a brief period of time to ensure that the customer service is not affected.

P a g e  | 133

–  Ensure  availability  of  appropriate  technology  solutions  to  measure  and  monitor  the
functioning  of  products.  And,  have  competent  and  capable  technical  people  within  the
system to resolve issues expeditiously.

      The  issues  detailed  above  have  to  be  borne  in  mind  while  finalising  the  data  centre
architecture and the corporate network architecture which are expected to have redundancy
built in the solution with no single point of failure.

      With  reference  to  the  network  architecture  it  is  recommended  that  the  Banks  built  in

redundancies as under:

−  Link level redundancy

−  Path level redundancy

−  Route level redundancy

−  Equipment level redundancy

−  Service provider level redundancy

Issues in choosing a backup site and implementing a DC or DR solution:

Backup  site:  Is  a  location  where  an  organisation  can  easily  relocate  following  a  disaster,
such  as  fire,  flood,  terrorist  threat  or  other  disruptive  event.  This  is  an  integral  part  of  the
disaster recovery plan and wider business continuity planning of an organisation. A backup
site can be another location operated by the organisation, or contracted via a company that
specialises  in  disaster  recovery  services.  In  some  cases,  an  organisation  will  have  an
agreement with a second organisation to operate a joint backup site.

There are three main types of backup sites:

•  cold sites

•  warm sites

•  hot sites

Differences  between  them  are  determined  by  costs  and  effort  required  to  implement  each.
Another term used to describe a backup site is a work area recovery site.

1. Cold Sites: A cold site is the most inexpensive type of backup site for an organisation to
operate.  It  does  not  include  backed  up  copies  of  data  and  information  from  the  original
location  of  the  organisation,  nor  does  it  include  hardware  already  set  up.  The  lack  of
hardware  contributes  to  the  minimal  start  up  costs  of  the  cold  site,  but  requires  additional
time following the disaster to have the operation running at a capacity close to that prior to
the disaster.

2.  Hot  Sites:  A  hot  site  is  a  duplicate  of  the  original  site  of  the  organisation,  with  full
computer  systems  as  well  as  near-complete  backups  of  user  data.  Real-time
synchronisation  between  the  two  sites  may  be  used  to  mirror  the  data  environment  of  the
original site, using wide area network links and specialised software. Following a disruption
to  the  original  site,  the  hot  site  exists  so  that  the  organisation  can  relocate  with  minimal
losses to normal operations. Ideally, a hot site will be up and running within a matter of hours
or even less. Personnel may still have to be moved to the hot site so it is possible that the
hot  site  may  be  operational  from  a  data  processing  perspective  before  staff  has  relocated.
The capacity of the hot site may or may not match the capacity of the original site depending
on  the  organisation's  requirements.  This  type  of  backup  site  is  the  most  expensive  to

P a g e  | 134

operate. Hot sites are popular with organisations that operate real time processes such as
financial institutions, government agencies and ecommerce providers

3. Warm Sites: A warm site is, quite logically, a compromise between hot and cold. These
sites  will  have  hardware  and  connectivity  already  established,  though  on  a  smaller  scale
than the original production site or even a hot site. Warm sites will have backups on hand,
but  they  may  not  be  complete  and  may  be  between  several  days  and  a  week  old.  An
example would be backup tapes sent to the warm site by courier.

8.1 The following issues arise in choosing a back up site and implementing a DC/DR
solution:

1. Solution architectures of DC and DR are not identical for all the applications and services.
Critical applications and services, namely the retail, corporate, trade finance and government
business solutions as well as the delivery channels are having the same DR configurations
whereas surround or interfacing applications do not have the DR support. Banks will have to
conduct periodical review with reference to the above aspect and upgrade the DR solutions
from  time  to  time  and  ensure  that  all  the  critical  applications  and  services  have  a  perfect
replica in terms of performance and availability.

2. The configurations of servers, network devices and other products at the DC and DR have
to be identical at all times. This includes the patches that are applied at the DC periodically
and  the  changes  made  to  the  software  from  time  to  time  by  customization  and
parameterization to account for the regulatory requirements, system changes etc .

3. Periodic checks with reference to ensuring data and transaction integrity between DC and
DR  are  mandatory.  It  could  be  done  over  the  week  end  or  as  a  part  of  the  EoD  /  BoD
process.

4.  Solutions  have  to  have  a  defined  Recovery  Time  Objective  (RTO)  and  Recovery  Point
Objective  (RPO)  parameter.  These  two  parameters  have  a  very  clear  bearing  on  the
technology  aspects  as  well  as  the  process  defined  for  cut  over  to  the  DR  and  the
competency levels required moving over in the specified time frame.

5.  Values  chosen  for  the  RTO  and  RPO  is  more  to  follow  the  industry  practice  and  not
derived from first principles. Therefore, the DR drills that are conducted periodically have to
ensure that the above parameters are strictly complied with.

6.  Technology  operations  processes  which  support  business  operations  (such  as  EOD/
BOD) need to formally included into the IT Continuity Plan.

7. Banks may also consider Recovery Time Objective and Recovery Point Objectives (RTO/
RPO) for services being offered and not just a specific application. For example--for internet
portal  and  not  retail  banking.  This  is  done  to  avoid  any  inconsistency  in  business  users
understanding.

6. DR drills currently conducted periodically come under the category of planned shutdown.
Banks  have  to  evolve  a  suitable  methodology  to  conduct  the  drills  which  are  closer  to  the
real  disaster  scenario  so  that  the  confidence  levels  of  the  technical  team  taking  up  this
exercise is built to address the requirement in the event of a real disaster.

7.  It  is  also  recommended  that  the  support  infrastructure  at  the  DC  and  DR,  namely  the
electrical  systems,  air-conditioning  environment  and  other  support  systems  have  no  single
point of failure and do have a building management and monitoring system to constantly and
continuously monitor the resources. If it is specified that the solution has a high availability of
99.95 measured on a monthly basis and a mean time to restore of 2 hrs in the event of any
failure, it has to include the support system also.

P a g e  | 135

8. Data replication mechanism followed between DC and DR is the asynchronous replication
mechanism  and  implemented  across  the  industry  either  using  database  replication
techniques  or  the  storage  based  replication  techniques.  They  do  have  relative  merits  and
demerits. The RTO and RPO discussed earlier, along with the replication mechanism used
and  the  data  transfer  required  to  be  accomplished  during  the  peak  load  will  decide  the
bandwidth required between the DC and the DR. The RPO is directly related to the latency
permissible  for  the  transaction  data  from  the  DC  to  update  the  database  at  the  DR.
Therefore, the process implemented for the data replication requirement has to conform to
the above and with no compromise to data and transaction integrity.

9. Given the need for drastically minimizing the data loss during exigencies and enable quick
recovery and continuity of critical business operations, banks may need to consider near site
DR  architecture.  Major  banks  with  significant  customer  delivery  channel  usage  and
significant  participation  in  financial  markets/payment  and  settlement  systems  may  need  to
have  a  plan  of  action  for  creating  a  near  site  DR  architecture  over  the  medium  term  (say,
within three years).

8.2 Issues/Challenges in DC/DR implementation by the Banks

(a)  Despite  considerable  advances  in  equipment  and  telecommunications  design  and
recovery  services,  IT  disaster  recovery  is  becoming  challenging.  Continuity  and
recovery  aspects  are impacting  IT  strategy  and  cost implications  are challenging IT
budgets.

(b)  The  time  window  for  recovery  is  shrinking  in  face  of  the  demand  for  24  /  365
that  around  30  percent  of  high-availability
operations.  Some  studies  claim
applications  have  to  be  recovered  in  less  than  three  hours.  A  further  45  percent
within 24 hours, before losses become unsustainable; others claim that 60 percent of
Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) Systems have to be restored in under 24 hours.
This means that traditional off-site backup and restore methods are often no longer
adequate. It simply takes too long to recover incremental and full image backups of
various  inter-related  applications  (backed  up  at  different  times),  synchronise  them
and re-create the position as at disaster. Continuous operation–data mirroring to off-
site  locations  and  standby  computing  and  telecommunications–may  be  the  only
solution.

(c)  A risk assessment and business impact analysis should establish the justification for

continuity for specific IT and telecommunication services and applications.

(d)  Achieving robust security (security assurance) is not a onetime activity. It cannot be
obtained  just  by  purchasing  and  installing  suitable  software  and  hardware.  It  is  a
continuous  process  that  requires  regular  assessment  of  the  security  health  of  the
organisation  and  proactive  steps  to  detect  and  fix  any  vulnerability.  Every  bank
should  have  in  place  quick  and  reliable  access  to  expertise  for  tracking  suspicious
behavior,  monitoring  users  and  performing  forensics.  Adequate  reporting  to  the
authorities  concerned  –  such  as  the  RBI/  IDRBT/CERT-In  and  other  institutions
should be an automatic sub process whenever such events occur.

Important steps that need to be institutionalised are the following:

a) Rigorous self-assessment of security measures by banks and comprehensive
security  audit  by  external  agencies,  as  detailed  under  the  “Chapter  on  Information
Security” earlier.

b)  Random  Security  Preparedness.  It  is  proposed  that  a  sufficiently  large
``question bank'' related to security health of the organization be prepared and given
to RBI's inspection teams who go for inspection of banks. A random subset of these
queries  could  then  be  given  to  a  bank’s  IT  team  for  which  answers  need  to  be

P a g e  | 136

provided  in  near  real  time.  Sample  checks  related  to  user  accounts  could  be  the
number  of  new  accounts,  terminated  accounts,  most  active  accounts.  There  could
also be demonstrations of data recovery from archives.

(e)  Telecommunications issues may also arise: It is important to ensure that relevant
links are in place and that communications capability is compatible. The adequacy of
voice and data capacity needs to be checked. Telephony needs to be switched from
the  disaster  site  to  the  standby  site.  A  financial  institution’s  BCP  should  consider
addressing  diversity  guidelines  for  its  telecommunications  capabilities.  This  is
particularly important for the financial services sector that provides critical payment,
clearing,  and  settlement  processes;  however,  diversity  guidelines  should  be
considered  by  all  financial  institutions  and  should  be  commensurate  with  the
institution’s size, complexity, and overall risk profile. Diversity guidelines may include
arrangements with multiple telecommunications providers. However, diverse routing
may  be  difficult  to  achieve  since  primary  telecommunications  carriers  may  have  an
agreement  with  the  same  sub-carriers  to  provide  local  access  service,  and  these
sub-carriers may also have a contract with the same local access service providers.
Financial  institutions  do  not  have  any  control  over  the  number  of  circuit  segments
that will be needed, and they typically do not have a business relationship with any of
the sub-carriers. Consequently, it is important for financial institutions to understand
the relationship between their primary telecommunications carrier and these various
sub-carriers  and  how  this  complex  network  connects  to  their  primary  and  back-up
facilities.  To  determine  whether  telecommunications  providers  use  the  same  sub-
carrier  or  local  access  service  provider,  banks  may  consider  performing  an  end-to-
end trace of all critical or sensitive circuits to search for single points of failure such
as a common switch, router, PBX, or central telephone office.

(f)  Banks  may  consider  the  following  telecommunications  diversity  components

to enhance BCP:

(i)  Alternative media, such as secure wireless systems

(ii)  Internet  protocol  networking  equipment  that  provides  easily  configurable  re-

routing and traffic load balancing capabilities

(iii) Local services to more than one telecommunications carrier’s central office, or

diverse physical paths to independent central offices

(iv) Multiple, geographically diverse cables and separate points of entry

(v) Frame relay circuits that do not require network interconnections, which often
causes delays due to concentration points between frame relay providers

(vi) Separate power sources for equipment with generator or uninterrupted power

supply back-up

(vii) Separate connections to back-up locations

(viii)

Regular  use  of  multiple  facilities  in  which  traffic  is  continually  split

between the connections; and

(ix) Separate suppliers for hardware and software infrastructure needs.

(g)  Banks  need  to  monitor  their  service  relationship  with  telecommunications
providers:  In  order  to  manage  the  inherent  risks  more  effectively.  In  coordination
with  vendors,  management  should  ensure  that  risk  management  strategies  include

P a g e  | 137

the following, at a minimum:

–  Establish  service  level  agreements  that  address  contingency  measures  and
change management for services provided;

– Ensure that primary and back-up telecommunications paths do not share a single
point of failure

–  Establish  processes  to  periodically  inventory  and  validate  telecommunications
circuits and routing paths through comprehensive testing.

(h)  Some  vendors  offer  a  drop-ship  service  as  an  alternative  to  occupying  the
standby site. That is, in the event of equipment failure, for instance, they will drop off
a  replacement  rather  than  insist  the  client  occupy  the  standby  site,  with  all  the
inconvenience that may involve. But it is essential that a site survey is undertaken to
ensure  they  can  be  parked  on  the  required  site.  Most  commercial  standby  sites
offering IT and work area recovery facilities do not guarantee a service: the contract
merely  provides  access  to  the  equipment.  Although  most  reputable  vendors  will
negotiate  a  Service  Level  Agreement  that  specifies  the  quality  of  the  service,  it  is
rarely offered.

It is important to ensure that a bank’s service will not suffer from unacceptable downtime
or response. The vendor may have skilled staff available – but this is rarely guaranteed
and they come at a cost. In terms of cost, there may be additional fees to pay for testing,
on  invocation  of  a  disaster,  and  for  occupation  in  a  disaster.  The  vendor  charging
structure also needs to be carefully considered.

(i)  Outsourcing Risks: In theory a commercial hot or warm standby site is available 24
/ 365. It has staff skilled in assisting recovery. Its equipment is constantly kept up to
date,  while  older  equipment  remains  supported.  It  is  always  available  for  use  and
offers  testing  periods  once  or  twice  a  year.  The  practice  may  be  different.  These
days,  organizations  have  a  wide  range  of  equipment  from  different  vendors  and
different models from the same vendor. Not every commercial standby site is able to
support the entire range of equipment that a bank may have. Instead, vendors form
alliances  with  others  –  but  this  may  mean  that  a  bank’s  recovery  effort  is  split
between  more  than  one  standby  site.  The  standby  site  may  not  have  identical  IT
equipment:  instead  of  the  use  of  an  identical  piece  of  equipment,  it  will  offer  a
partition  on a  compatible  large  computer  or  server.  Operating  systems  and  security
packages  may  not  be  the  same  version  as  the  client  usually  uses.  These  aspects
may cause setbacks when attempting recovery of IT systems and applications – and
weak  change  control  at  the  recovery  site  could  cause  a  disaster  on  return  to  the
normal site.

It is the responsibility of the IT manager/bank to ensure effective recovery by those vendors,
who  apply  the  highest  standards,  supporting  this  by  a  stringent  contract,  clearly  defining
service specifications and technical requirements, and service-level agreements.

CHAPTER 8- CUSTOMER EDUCATION

Introduction:

With the advent of electronic banking, the neighbourhood bank has set up a branch on the
desktop of the customer. The customer’s experience of banking is therefore no longer fully
under the control of the bank. In the age of the self-service model of banking, the customer
also has to be equipped to do safe banking through self help.  It is often said that the best
defence  against  frauds  is  an  aware  customer.  With  fraudsters  constantly  creating  more
diverse  and  complex  fraudulent  ruses  using  advanced  technology  and  social  engineering
techniques  to  access  their  victims’  accounts,  spreading  awareness  among  consumers
becomes imperative.

Some  banks  regularly  run  campaigns  to  raise  consumer  awareness  on  a  variety  of  fraud
related  issues.  However,  to  generate  a  standard  understanding  of  the  evolving  fraud
scenarios, a combined effort could proliferate the information to a larger customer base. It is
also important to educate the other stakeholders, including bank employees, who can then
act  as  resource  persons  for  customer  queries,  law  enforcement  personnel  for  more
understanding  response  to  customer  complaints  and  media  for  dissemination  of  accurate
and timely information.

Scope:

Illustrate how to plan, organise and implement a fraud awareness raising initiative

(cid:131)
(cid:131)  Provide a framework to evaluate the effectiveness of an awareness program
(cid:131)  Offer a communication framework
(cid:131)  Highlight  potential  risks  associated  with  awareness  initiatives  in  an  effort  to  avoid

such issues in future programs

(cid:131)  Contribute to the development of a safe and secure culture by encouraging users to

act responsibly and operate more securely

1) Roles and Responsibility - Board of Directors/Senior Management:

There needs to be commitment from the Board of Directors/Senior Management towards the
process  of  consumer  education  initiatives  by  providing  adequate  resources,  evaluating  the
effectiveness of the process and fine-tuning and improving customer education measures on
an ongoing process.

2) Organisational structure

Working group

To  get  desired  support  for  the  programme,  it  is  important  to  identify  and  involve  key
stakeholders in decision-making, planning, implementation and evaluation.

•  Establish a clear goal for the endpoint, in consultation with key stakeholders.
•  Clearly define roles, responsibilities and accountabilities.
•  Communicate in an open, honest, clear and timely manner.

P a g e  | 139

•  Allow for flexibility in approaches to suit different stakeholder needs.
•  Support with training and development to ensure a change in behaviour and culture.
•  Learn from previous and ongoing experiences and celebrate achievements.

3) Communication Strategy

1.  Defining ‘Awareness’

Security  awareness  is  the  understanding  and  knowledge  of  the  threats  to  the  sensitive
personal  information  of  the  customer  and  the  protection  measures  to  be  adopted.  It  is  the
basic  component  of  the  education  strategy  of  an  organisation  which  tries  to  change  the
attitude,  behaviour  and  practice  of  its  target  audience  (e.g.  customers,  general  public,
employees etc.). Awareness activities need to be done an ongoing basis, using a variety of
delivery methods and are less formal and shorter than formal training processes.

The  purpose  of  awareness  presentations  is  simply  to  focus  attention  on  security.  Such
presentations are intended to allow individuals to recognise security concerns and respond
accordingly. In awareness activities, the learner is only the recipient of information.

2.  Suggested approach for awareness programmes

The three main stages in the development of an awareness programme are:

a. Planning and design : Awareness programmes can be successful only if users feel
the content is in their interest and is relevant to their banking needs. In the planning
stage,  the  needs  of  the  target  audience  should  be  identified,  a  plan  developed,
organizational  buy-in  and  appropriate  budgets  obtained  and  priorities  established.
The work plan should clearly mention the main activities with the required resources,
timelines and milestones. This plan must be reviewed periodically as the programme
progresses.

b.Execution  and  management  :This  process  focuses  on  the  activities  to  implement
the  awareness  program.  A  suitable  vendor  should  be  engaged  for  content  creation
and publication.

c.Evaluation  and  course  correction  :Continuous  improvement  cannot  occur  without
knowing how the existing programme is working. A well-calibrated feedback strategy
must be designed and implemented.

The component processes under the above sections can be listed as under:

Plan, assess and design

Execute and manage

Evaluate and adjust

Establish a working group

3.  Target audience

Since awareness programmes should be customized for a specific audience, it is important
to identify and segment the target users for the programs.

The target groups for these programs would be:

•  Bank customers
•  Bank employees and consultants
•  Law Enforcement Agencies – Police, Judiciary and Consumer Forums
•  Fraud risk professionals
•  Media personnel
•  Channel partners and suppliers
•  General  public  of  varying  age  and  technical  knowledge  –  children,  youth,  adults,

senior citizens and silver surfers

4.  Stake holder support

P a g e  | 141

financial  and
Building  consensus  amongst  decision  makers  and  stakeholders
administrative support is an important step in the programme. In this respect, both fixed and
variable  costs  need  to  be  identified.  These  will  include  personnel,  operational  costs,
awareness material, advertisements and promotions and maintenance of website.

for

The common objectives of the awareness programme will be to:

•  Provide  a  focal  point  and  a  driving  force  for  a  range  of  awareness,  training  and

educational activities

•  Provide general and specific information about fraud risk trends, types or controls to

people who need to know

•  Help consumers identify areas vulnerable to fraud attempts and make them aware of

their responsibilities in relation to fraud prevention

•  Motivate individuals to adopt recommended guidelines or practices
•  Create a stronger culture of security with better understanding and commitment
•  Help minimise the number and extent of incidents, thus reducing costs directly (fraud

losses) and indirectly (for eg., reduced need to investigate)

5.   Concept of communication

Communication is crucial for the success of any awareness programme. The key elements
of effective communication are:

•  Ability to reach out to a broad audience which can contribute to the multiplier effect to

maximize the reach of the message

•  Not to be alarming or overly negative about a situation. If issues or risks need to be
detailed, it is often easier for the audience to understand in the context of real world
experiences

•  Deliver  the  right  message  content  to  the  right  audience  using  the  most  effective

communication channels

•  The message should state the risks and threats facing the users, why it is relevant to
them, what to do and not to do, and finally how to be protected. The message should
be compelling and clearly state why security is important. Users who understand why
certain types of behaviour are risky are most likely to take ownership of the issue and
change their behaviour.

6.  Communication content

The  messages  through  these  communications  would  carry  information  related  to  various
frauds  in  general  with  specific  focus  on  electronic  frauds  through  fake  websites,  phishing,
vishing, skimming and emails.

7.  Communication collaterals

Awareness building collaterals can be created in the form of:

•  Leaflets and brochures
•  Educational material in account opening kits
•  Safety tips in cheque books, PIN, account statements and envelopes
•  Receipts dispensed by ATMs

P a g e  | 142

•  DVDs with animated case studies and videos
•  Screensavers
•  Electronic newsletters
•  Short Messaging Service (SMS) texts
•  Recorded messages played during waiting period of phone banking calls

The collaterals should be created in regional languages wherever required.

8.  Communication channels

Since  the  target  groups  obtain  information  from  a  variety  of  sources,  more  than  one
communication channel could be used to engage them successfully. These could be:

•  Advertising campaigns though print and TV media
•  Talk shows on television/radio
•  Customer meets and interactive sessions with specialists
•  Common website developed with content from all stakeholders
•  Online training modules and demos hosted on this site
•  Groups, games and profiles on social media
•  Advertisements on online shopping sites
•  Bill boards
•  Posters in prominent locations such as petrol pumps and popular restaurants
•
•  ATM screens , Emails and SMS texts
•  Distance learning programmes and demos

Interactive guidance in the form of helplines

The  message  delivered,  the  channels  used  and  the  sender  of  the  message  should  be
influential and credible, otherwise the target group may be less inclined to listen.

An  effective  way  to  deliver  the  message  would  be  the  use  of  multipliers  that  can  help
communicate to a broad range of audience. Few examples of such bodies could be:

•  Community centres
•  Schools and colleges
•  Computer and book stores
•  Libraries
•  NGOs
•  Clubs
•  Adult education centres

9.  Research and analysis

In addition to the above, a research group should be formed to continually update the team
with the latest trends and evolving modus operandi. The team would maintain a repository of
material such as:

•  Case studies
•  Sample mails
•  Sample of fraudulent documents
•  Data collected from victims or targets of frauds
International practices and developments
•

P a g e  | 143

10. Evaluation

Evaluation  of  the  effects  of  various  campaigns  for  specific  target  groups  can  be  measured
through  qualitative  (e.g.  focus  groups,  interviews)  and/or  quantitative  (e.g.  questionnaires,
omnibus surveys) research. Evaluation against metrics, performance objectives, etc. should
also be conducted to check the campaign’s effectiveness, and to establish lessons learned
to improve future initiatives.

Other issues relating to bank customer education:

Apart from regular education efforts, when new operating features or functions, particularly
those  relating  to  security,  integrity  and  authentication,  are  being  introduced,  banks  should
ensure  that  customers  have  sufficient  instruction  and  information  to  be  able  to  properly
utilize them. Continual education and timely information provided to customers will help them
to  understand  security  requirements  and  take  appropriate  steps  in  reporting  security
problems.

Introduction

CHAPTER 9: LEGAL ISSUES

Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision,  in  its  “Consultative  Document  on  Operational
Risk”,  defines  “operational  risk”  as  the  risk  of  direct,  or  indirect,  loss  resulting  from
inadequate or failed internal processes, people and systems, or from external events. This
definition includes legal risk1.

The  Information Technology Act,  2000  (IT Act, 2000)  was enacted  to handle  certain  issues
relating  to  Information  Technology.  The  IT  Amendment  Act,  2008  has  made  further
modifications to address more issues such as cyber crimes. It is critical that impact of cyber
laws is taken into consideration by banks to obviate any risk arising there from.

A. Guidance for Banks

Roles and Responsibilities and Organizational Structure

Board:  The  Risk  Management  Committee  at  the  Board-level  needs  to  put  in  place,  the
processes to ensure that legal risks arising from cyber laws are identified and addressed. It
also  needs  to  ensure  that  the  concerned  functions  are  adequately  staffed  and  that  the
human resources are trained to carry out the relevant tasks in this regard

Operational Risk Group: This group needs to incorporate legal risks as part of operational
risk  framework  and  take  steps  to  mitigate  the  risks  involved  in  consultation  with  its  legal
functions within the bank.

Legal Department: The legal function within the bank needs to advise the business groups
on the legal issues arising out of use of Information Technology with respect to the legal risk
identified and referred to it by the Operational Risk Group.

Computer related offences and Penalty/Punishment
The  IT Act,  2000  as  amended,  exposes  the  banks  to  both  civil2  and  criminal3  liability.  The
civil  liability  could  consist  of  exposure  to  pay  damages  by  way  of  compensation  upto
  5
crore  under  the  amended  Information  Technology  Act  before  the  Adjudicating  Officer  and
beyond
  five  crore  in  a  court  of  competent  jurisdiction.  There  could  also  be  exposure  to
criminal  liability  to  the  top  management  of  the  banks  given  the  provisions  of  Chapter  XI  of
the amended IT Act4 and the exposure to criminal liability could consist of imprisonment for a
term which could extend from three years to life imprisonment as also fine. Further, various
computer related offences are enumerated in the aforesaid provisions.

Critical aspects

(a)  Legal risk and operational risk are same. Most risks are sought to be covered
by  documentation,  particularly  where  the  law  is  silent.  The  Basel-II  accord

covers “legal risk” under “operational risk.” Documentation forms an important
part  of  the  banking  and  financial  sector.  For  many,  documentation  is  a
panacea to the legal risks that may arise in banking activities. But then, it has
also  been  realized  and  widely  acknowledged  that  loopholes  do  exist  in
documentation.

(b) Legal  risks  need  to  be  incorporated  as  part  of  operational  risks  and  the
position  need  to  be  periodically  communicated  to  the  top  management  and
Board/Risk Management Committee of the Board.

(as  amended

in  2008),  various

(c)  As  the  law  on  data  protection  and  privacy,  in  the  Indian  context  are  in  an
evolving stage, banks have to keep in view the specific provisions of IT Act,
2000
judicial
pronouncements  and related developments in the Cyber laws in India as part
of legal risk mitigation measures. Banks are also required to keep abreast of
latest  developments  in  the  IT  Act,  2000  and  the  rules,  regulations,
notifications  and  orders  issued  there  under  pertaining  to  bank  transactions
and  emerging  legal  standards  on  digital  signature,  electronic  signature,  data
protection,  cheque  truncation,  electronic  fund  transfer  etc.  as  part  of  overall
operational risk management process.

The Chairman/ Managing Director /Chief Executive Officer
All Scheduled Commercial Banks (excluding Regional Rural Banks)

Madam / Dear Sir,

Introduction

Cyber Security Framework in Banks

Use  of  Information  Technology  by  banks  and  their  constituents  has  grown  rapidly
and is now an integral part of the operational strategies of banks. The Reserve Bank,
had,  provided  guidelines  on  Information  Security,  Electronic  Banking,  Technology
Risk  Management  and  Cyber  Frauds  (G.Gopalakrishna  Committee)  vide  Circular
DBS.CO.ITC.BC.No.6/31.02.008/2010-11  dated  April  29,  2011,  wherein  it  was
indicated  that  the  measures  suggested  for  implementation  cannot  be  static  and
banks  need  to  pro-actively  create/fine-tune/modify  their  policies,  procedures  and
technologies based on new developments and emerging concerns.

2. Since then, the use of technology by banks has gained further momentum. On the
other  hand,  the  number,  frequency  and  impact  of  cyber  incidents  /  attacks  have
increased  manifold  in  the  recent  past,  more  so  in  the  case  of  financial  sector
including  banks,  underlining  the  urgent  need  to  put  in  place  a  robust  cyber
security/resilience  framework  at  banks  and  to  ensure  adequate  cyber-security
preparedness  among  banks  on  a  continuous  basis.  In  view  of  the  low  barriers  to
entry,  evolving  nature,  growing  scale/velocity,  motivation  and  resourcefulness  of
cyber-threats to  the  banking  system,  it  is  essential  to  enhance  the  resilience  of  the
banking system by improving the current defences in addressing cyber risks. These
would  include,  but  not  limited  to,  putting  in  place  an  adaptive  Incident  Response,
Management and Recovery framework to deal with adverse incidents/disruptions, if
and when they occur.

Need for a Board approved Cyber-security Policy

3. Banks  should  immediately  put  in  place  a  cyber-security  policy  elucidating  the
strategy containing an appropriate approach to combat cyber threats given the level
of  complexity  of  business  and  acceptable  levels  of  risk,  duly  approved  by  their

Board.    A  confirmation  in  this  regard  may  be  communicated  to  Cyber  Security  and
Information  Technology  Examination  (CSITE)  Cell  of  Department  of  Banking
Supervision, Reserve Bank of India, Central Office, World Trade Centre-I, 4th Floor,
Cuffe  Parade,  Mumbai  400005  at  the  earliest,  and  in  any  case  not  later  than
September 30, 2016.

It may be ensured that the strategy deals with the following broad aspects:

Cyber  Security  Policy  to  be  distinct  from  the  broader  IT  policy  /  IS  Security
Policy of a bank

4.  In  order  to  address  the  need  for  the  entire  bank  to  contribute  to  a  cyber-safe
environment,  the  Cyber  Security  Policy  should  be  distinct  and  separate  from  the
broader  IT  policy  /  IS  Security  policy  so  that  it  can  highlight  the  risks  from  cyber
threats and the measures to address / mitigate these risks.

the

5.  The  size,  systems,  technological  complexity,  digital  products,  stakeholders  and
threat  perception  vary  from  bank  to  bank  and  hence  it  is  important  to  identify  the
inherent  risks  and  the  controls  in  place  to  adopt  appropriate  cyber-security
framework. While identifying and assessing the inherent risks, banks are required to
reckon
technologies  adopted,  alignment  with  business  and  regulatory
requirements,  connections  established,  delivery  channels,  online  /  mobile  products,
technology  services,  organisational  culture  and
threats.
Depending  on  the  level  of  inherent  risks,  the  banks  are  required  to  identify  their
riskiness  as  low,  moderate,  high  and  very  high  or  adopt  any  other  similar
categorisation. Riskiness of the business component also may be factored into while
assessing the inherent risks. While evaluating the controls, Board oversight, policies,
processes, cyber risk management architecture including experienced and qualified
intelligence  gathering  arrangements,
resources,
monitoring  and  analysing  the  threat  intelligence  received  vis-à-vis  the  situation
obtaining  in  banks,  information  sharing  arrangements  (among  peer  banks,  with
IDRBT/RBI/CERT-In),  preventive,  detective  and  corrective  cyber  security  controls,
vendor management and incident management & response are to be outlined.

threat

Arrangement for continuous surveillance

6.  Testing  for  vulnerabilities  at  reasonable  intervals  of  time  is  very  important.  The
nature  of  cyber-attacks  are  such  that  they  can  occur  at  any  time  and  in  a  manner
that  may  not  have  been  anticipated.  Hence,  it  is  mandated  that  a  SOC  (Security
Operations Centre) be set up at the earliest, if not yet been done. It is also essential
that  this  Centre  ensures  continuous  surveillance  and  keeps  itself  regularly  updated
on the latest nature of emerging cyber threats.

IT architecture should be conducive to security

7.  The  IT  architecture  should  be  designed  in  such  a  manner  that  it  takes  care  of
facilitating the security measures to be in place at all times. The same needs to be
reviewed  by  the  IT  Sub  Committee  of  the  Board  and  upgraded,  if  required,  as  per
their  risk  assessment  in  a  phased  manner.  The  risk  cost/potential  cost  trade  off
decisions  which  a  bank  may  take  should  be  recorded  in  writing  to  enable  an
appropriate supervisory assessment subsequently.

8. An indicative, but not exhaustive, minimum baseline cyber security and resilience
framework  to  be  implemented  by  the  banks  is  given  in  Annex  1.  Banks  should
proactively  initiate  the  process  of  setting  up  of  and  operationalising  a  Security
Operations  Centre  (SOC)  to  monitor  and  manage  cyber  risks  in  real  time.  An
indicative configuration of the SOC is given in Annex 2.

Comprehensively address network and database security

9. Recent incidents have highlighted the need to thoroughly review network security
in  every  bank.  In  addition,  it  has  been  observed  that  many  times  connections  to
networks/databases  are  allowed  for  a  specified  period  of  time  to  facilitate  some
business  or  operational  requirement.  However,  the  same  do  not  get  closed  due  to
oversight  making  the  network/database  vulnerable  to  cyber-attacks.  It  is  essential
that  unauthorized  access  to  networks  and  databases  is  not  allowed  and  wherever
permitted,  these  are  through  well-defined  processes  which  are  invariably  followed.
Responsibility  over  such  networks  and  databases  should  be  clearly  elucidated  and
should invariably rest with the officials of the bank.

Ensuring Protection of customer information

10. Banks depend on technology very heavily not only in their smooth functioning but
also in providing cutting-edge digital products to their consumers and in the process
collect  various  personal  and  sensitive  information.  Banks,  as  owners  of  such  data,
should  take  appropriate  steps  in  preserving  the  Confidentiality,  Integrity  and
Availability  of  the  same,  irrespective  of  whether  the  data  is  stored/in  transit  within
themselves  or  with  customers  or  with  the  third  party  vendors;  the  confidentiality  of
such  custodial  information  should  not  be  compromised  at  any  situation  and  to  this
end, suitable systems and processes across the data/information lifecycle need to be
put in place by banks.

Cyber Crisis Management Plan

11.  A  Cyber  Crisis  Management  Plan  (CCMP)  should  be  immediately  evolved  and
should  be  a  part  of  the  overall  Board  approved  strategy.  Considering  the  fact  that
cyber-risk  is  different  from  many  other  risks,  the  traditional  BCP/DR  arrangements
may not be adequate and hence needs to be revisited keeping in view the nuances
of  the  cyber-risk.    As you  may  be  aware,  in  India,  CERT-IN  (Computer  Emergency
Response Team – India, a Government entity) has been taking important initiatives
in strengthening cyber-security by providing proactive & reactive services as well as
guidelines, threat intelligence and assessment of preparedness of various agencies
across the sectors, including the financial sector. CERT-IN also have come out with
National  Cyber  Crisis  Management  Plan  and  Cyber  Security  Assessment
Framework.  CERT-In/NCIIPC/RBI/IDRBT  guidance  may  be  referred
to  while
formulating the CCMP.

12. CCMP should address the following four aspects: (i) Detection (ii) Response (iii)
Recovery and (iv) Containment.  Banks need to take effective measures to prevent
cyber-attacks and to promptly detect any cyber-intrusions so as to respond / recover
/  contain  the  fall  out.  Banks  are  expected  to  be  well  prepared  to  face  emerging
cyber-threats  such  as  ‘zero-day’  attacks,  remote  access  threats,  and  targeted
attacks. Among other things, banks should take necessary preventive and corrective
measures  in  addressing  various  types  of  cyber  threats  including,  but  not  limited  to,
denial of service, distributed denial of services (DDoS), ransom-ware / crypto ware,
destructive  malware,  business  email  frauds  including  spam,  email  phishing,  spear
phishing, whaling, vishing frauds, drive-by downloads, browser gateway fraud, ghost
administrator  exploits,  identity  frauds,  memory  update  frauds,  password  related
frauds, etc.

Cyber security preparedness indicators

13.  The  adequacy  of  and  adherence  to  cyber  resilience  framework  should  be
assessed  and  measured  through  development  of  indicators  to  assess  the  level  of
risk/preparedness.  These  indicators  should  be  used  for  comprehensive  testing
through  independent  compliance  checks  and  audits  carried  out  by  qualified  and
including
competent  professionals.  The  awareness  among
employees may also form a part of this assessment.

the  stakeholders

Sharing of information on cyber-security incidents with RBI

14.  It  is  observed  that  banks  are  hesitant  to  share  cyber-incidents  faced  by  them.
However, the experience gained globally indicates that collaboration among entities
in sharing the cyber-incidents and the best practices would facilitate timely measures

in containing cyber-risks. It is reiterated that banks need to report all unusual cyber-
security  incidents  (whether  they  were  successful  or  were  attempts  which  did  not
fructify)  to  the  Reserve  Bank.  Banks  are  also  encouraged  to  actively  participate  in
the  activities  of  their  CISOs’  Forum  coordinated  by  IDRBT  and  promptly  report  the
incidents to Indian Banks – Center for Analysis of Risks and Threats (IB-CART) set
up  by  IDRBT.  Such  collaborative  efforts  will  help  the  banks  in  obtaining  collective
threat intelligence, timely alerts and adopting proactive cyber security measures.

Supervisory Reporting framework

15. It has been decided to collect both summary level information as well as details
on  information  security  incidents  including  cyber-incidents.  Banks  are  required  to
report promptly the incidents, in the format given in Annex-3.

An immediate assessment of gaps in preparedness to be reported to RBI

16.  The  material  gaps  in  controls  may  be  identified  early  and  appropriate  remedial
action under the active guidance and oversight of the IT Sub Committee of the Board
as well as by the Board may be initiated immediately. The identified gaps, proposed
measures/controls  and  their  expected  effectiveness,  milestones  with  timelines  for
implementing
for
assessing  their  effectiveness  including  the  risk  assessment  and  risk  management
methodology  followed  by  the  bank/proposed  by  the  bank,  as  per  their  self-
assessment,  may  be  submitted  to  the  Cyber  Security  and  Information  Technology
Examination (CSITE) Cell of Department of Banking Supervision, Central Office not
later than July 31, 2016 by the Chief Information Security Officer.

the  proposed  controls/measures  and  measurement  criteria

Organisational arrangements

17.  Banks  should  review  the  organisational  arrangements  so  that  the  security
concerns  are  appreciated,  receive  adequate  attention  and  get  escalated  to
appropriate levels in the hierarchy to enable quick action.

Cyber-security awareness among stakeholders / Top Management / Board

18.  It  should  be  realized  that  managing  cyber  risk  requires  the  commitment  of  the
entire organization to create a cyber-safe environment. This will require a high level
of  awareness  among  staff  at  all  levels.  Top  Management  and  Board  should  also
have a fair degree of awareness of the fine nuances of the threats and appropriate
familiarisation  may  be  organized.  Banks  should  proactively  promote,  among  their
customers,  vendors,  service  providers  and  other  relevant  stakeholders  an
understanding  of  the  bank’s  cyber  resilience  objectives,  and  require  and  ensure
appropriate action to support their synchronised implementation and testing. It is well

recognised  that  stakeholders’  (including  customers,  employees,  partners  and
vendors)  awareness  about  the  potential  impact  of  cyber-attacks  helps  in  cyber-
security preparedness of banks. Banks are required to take suitable steps in building
this awareness. Concurrently, there is an urgent need to bring the Board of Directors
and Top Management in banks up to speed on cyber-security related aspects, where
necessary, and hence banks are advised to take immediate steps in this direction.

Baseline Cyber Security and Resilience Requirements

An  indicative  but  not exhaustive  list  of  requirements  to be  put  in place  by  banks  to
is  given.  This  may  be  evaluated
achieve  baseline  cyber-security/resilience
periodically to integrate risks that arise due to newer threats, products or processes.
Important  security  controls  for  effective  cyber  security  as  may  be  articulated  by
CERT-In also may be referred. Some of the key points to be kept in mind are:

a.  In view of the growing technology adoption and potential threats, the role of IT
Sub-committee  may  be  reviewed;  Board  level  involvement  and  guidance
would set the right tone at the top.

b.  It is important to endeavour to stay ahead of the adversary.
c.  Cyber Security Operations Centre should have the capacity to monitor various

logs / incidents in real time / near real time.

d.  It is important to keep the vigil and to constantly remain alert.
e.  While hardware devices and software applications may provide security, it is

important to configure them appropriately.

f.  Human  resources  are  the  key  and  ensure  that  they  are  provided  with
appropriate training. Communicate the security policy of the bank periodically.

Setting up and Operationalising Cyber Security Operation Centre (C-SOC)

Introduction

1 - Banking Industry in India has evolved technologically over the years and currently
delivering  innovative  services  to  its  customers.  These  services  are  delivered
nonstop,  round  the  clock  and  the  customers  access  these  services  using  Internet
and  Mobile  Connectivity.  Security  of  the  financial  transactions  is  of  paramount
importance  and  therefore  the  RBI  has  come  out  with  guidelines  from  time  to  time
addressing  the  security  and  operational  aspects  for  specific  applications  and
services.

2 - It is important and pertinent to look at specifically the Internet facing applications
and  services  that  are  currently  delivered  and  proposed  to  be  delivered  in  the
immediate  future  in  the  Banking  Industry  and  come  out  with  Cyber  Security
guidelines across the applications and services.

3  -  Constant  and  Continuous  monitoring  of  the  environment  using  appropriate  and
cost  effective  technology  tools,  clearly  defined  policies  and  procedures  based  on
best practices and monitored by technically competent and capable manpower is the
urgent need for the Industry. Compliance to the Government guidelines that are put
out  periodically  covering  the  cyber  security  policy,  protecting  critical  information
infrastructure and the Information Technology Act are of paramount importance. It is
important to address the governance, technology, operational, outsourcing and legal
issues while setting up the Cyber Security Operations Centre.

4 – Issues that need to be  kept in mind while setting up the CSOC is given below.
These are indicative but not exhaustive.

Governance Aspects:

•  Top Management/Board Briefing on Threat Intelligence
•  Dashboards and oversight
•  Policy, measurement and enforcement (key metrics, reporting structure,

define what is to be reported)
Informing stakeholders , stakeholder participation

        Cyber SoC: Points to be considered

1  -  Conventional  or  Traditional  Security  systems  have  always  focussed  on
preventive approaches over the years and are reactive in nature. They are in
a position to address the concerns regarding known attacks. It is to be noted
that  the  threat  landscape  has  changed  significantly  in  the  recent  past  and
therefore  the  approach  and  methodology  required  to  be  put  in  place  has  to
necessarily  take  into  account  proactive  approaches  rather  than  reactive
approaches  and  have  to  also  address  possible  unknown  attacks.  For
example, zero day attacks and attacks for which signatures are not available
have to be kept in mind.

2  -  The  Cyber  SoC  has  to  take  into  account  proactive  monitoring  and
management  capabilities  with  sophisticated
for  detection,  quick
response and backed by data and tools for sound analytics.

tools

3  -  The  systems  that  are  implemented  currently  to  monitor  the  security
operation takes into account collection of the logs from each one of the point
products  deployed,  storing  and  processing  of  the  logs,  correlation  through
appropriate  SIEM  tools,  continuous  monitoring  of  SIEM  screens  and  finding
the anomalies, if any and raising the alarms.

4  -  The  systems  that  NEED  to  be  put  in  place  as  a  part  of  the  Cyber  SoC
requires the following aspects to be addressed.

  Methods  to  identify  root  cause  of  attacks,  classify  them  into  identified

categories  and  come  out  with  solutions  to  contain  further  attacks  of

similar types.



Incident investigation, forensics and deep packet analysis need to be in

place to achieve the above.

  Dynamic  Behaviour  Analysis.  –  preliminary  static  &  dynamic  analysis

and collecting Indicators of Compromise (IOC)

  Analytics with good dash board, showing the Geo-location of the IP’s

  Counter response and Honeypot services

Annex to Circular on Cyber Security Framework in Banks

Expectations from SOC:

  Ability  to  Protect  critical  business  and  customer  data/information,

demonstrate  compliance  with  internal  guidelines,  country  regulations

and laws

  Ability  to  Provide  real-time/near-real  time  information  on  and  insight

into the security posture of the bank

  Ability  to  Effectively  and  Efficiently  manage  security  operations  by

preparing for and responding to cyber risks/threats, facilitate continuity

and recovery

  Ability to assess threat intelligence and the proactively identify/visualize

impact of threats on the bank

  Ability  to  know  who  did  what,  when  ,    how  and  preservation  of

evidence



Integration  of  various  log  types  and  logging  options  into  SIEM,

ticketing/workflow/case  management,  unstructured  data/big  data,

reporting/dashboard, use cases/rule design (customized based on risk

and compliance requirements/drivers, etc.), etc.

Key Responsibilities of SOC could include:

  Monitor, analyze and escalate security incidents

  Develop Response - protect, detect, respond, recover

  Conduct Incident Management and Forensic Analysis

  Co-ordination with contact groups within the bank/external agencies

5 - Building blocks for the Cyber SoC:

TECHNOLOGY ISSUES:

First  step  is  to  arrive  at  a  suitable  and  cost  effective  technology  framework
designed and implemented to ensure proactive monitoring capabilities aligned
with  the  banking  technology  risk  profile  and  business  and  regulatory

requirements.  Clear  understanding  of  the  service  delivery  architecture
deployed  by  the  Bank  to  deliver  innovative  customer  services  will  enable
identification of the location for the sensors to collect the logs that are required
to  carry  out  the  analysis  and  investigation.  SIEM  is  able  to  meet  this
requirement  to  some  extent  but  a  holistic  approach  to  problem  identification
and solution is required.

Second step is to have security analytics engine which can process the logs
within  reasonable  time  frame  and  come  out  with  possible  recommendations
with options for further deep dive investigations

Third step is to look at deep packet inspection approaches which are currently
implemented  using  the  UTM  solutions  that  deliver  wire  speed  performance
with on the fly deep packet inspection.

Fourth  step  is  to  have  tools  and  technologies  for  malware  detection  and
analysis  as  well  as  imaging  solutions  for  data  to  address  the  forensics
requirements

It  is to  be  noted  that  the  solution  architecture  deployed for the  above  has  to
address  performance  and  scalability  requirements  in  addition  to  high
availability.

Need to think through by appropriately designing the

•  SIEM architecture & use cases

•  Log types and logging options (data sources, integration into SIEM)

•

Integration  of  various  log  types  and  logging  options  into  the  SIEM,

ticketing/workflow/case  management,  unstructured  data/big  data,

reporting/dashboard, use cases/rule design (customized based on risk and

compliance requirements/drivers, etc.), etc.

•  Technology for improving effectiveness and efficiency (tracking of metrics,

analytics, scorecards, dashboards, etc.)

PROCESS RELATED ASPECTS:

4

भारतीय ररज़र्व बैंक
_________________________ RESERVE BANK OF INDIA_____________________
www.rbi.org.in

Annex to Circular on Cyber Security Framework in Banks
One  of  the  key  aspects  that  require  attention  while  designing  the  CSC  is  to
understand the process to be followed to identify the root cause of a security
breach and further steps to mitigate such attacks in future.

Incident Management

Problem  management  processes  with  reference  to  security  operations
Vulnerability  and  Patch  Management  Security  risk  management  Availability
management  Computer  forensics  and  response  management  are  the  key
metrics  that  need  to  be  well  understood  and  architectured  while  configuring
the solution.

PEOPLE RELATED ISSUES:

CSC  is  managed  and  monitored  by  competent  and  capable  staff  round  the
clock  and  therefore  it  is  important  to  look  at  a  suitable  structure  for  this
requirement.

The Level 1 monitoring by adequately trained staff working round the clock is
the first step. They need to have training and  product/ vendor certification to
handle the tasks efficiently.

Level  2  deals  with  highly  trained  staff  in  specific  areas  of  network,  data
security, end point security  etc. to address the requirements especially  while
carrying out the root cause analysis as well as suitable corrective steps.

Level 3 staff are called the SoC analysts. They have profound knowledge of
security, perform deep packet analysis, collection of IOC, forensic knowledge
for  collection  of  evidence,  malware  reverse  engineering  and  write  custom
scripts whenever required.

It is to be noted that all the staff involved in the above exercise need to have a
good  knowledge  of  the  products  and  services  deployed  by  the  respective
Bank.

•  Banks  need  to  seriously  consider  practical  ways  of  tackling  the  following

issues when it comes to hiring and managing staff/people for SOC. It is not

any  other  function  in  the  bank.  There  has  to  be  a  different  approach

5

भारतीय ररज़र्व बैंक

Annex to Circular on Cyber Security Framework in Banks
because  such  personnel  with  required  skill  sets  that  are  hard  to  find  and

retain.

•  Staffing of SOC  – is it required to be 24x7x365, in shifts, business hours

only….etc.

•  Model  used  -  Finding  staff  with  required  skills  /managed  service  provider

with required skill set

•  Training own staff/training of staff by service provider

•  Appropriate  compensation/incentives  to  retain  trained  staff  /staff  with

required skill set

•  Metrics to measure performance of SOC

•  Ensuring  scalability  and  continuity  of  staff  through  appropriate  capacity

planning initiatives

EXTERNAL INTEGRATION:

While delivering services to the customers of the Bank, several stake holders
are  involved  directly  or  otherwise.  They  do  have  experience  which  could  be
very  useful.  For  example  the  threat  intelligence  feeds  from  various  sources
may  be  provided  by  the  product  vendors  and  other  major  players  in  the
technology  landscape.  Security  information  feeds  from  other  Banks  in
particular and the financial ecosystem in general will be quite useful.

Cyber  response  cells,  CERT-In  and  telecom  service  providers  of  the  Bank
may add value to the discussions based on the happenings in the Industry at
large.

IDENTIFYING A SUITABLE MODEL FOR IMPLEMENTATION:

Some of the decisions which have to be taken upfront is to look at BOO or the
Outsourcing  model. It is difficult to  reverse  this decision  post  implementation
and therefore it is important.

- Should the SoC be in-house or outsourced?
-  Should  it  address  only  the  Internet  facing  environment  or  the  complete  IT
infrastructure?

Annex to Circular on Cyber Security Framework in Banks
-  Does  each  Bank  need  to  set  up  independently  or  should  we  look  at  the
consortium based approach?
- Do we need to keep in mind the Bank's risk posture?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------
Points to keep in mind while planning for SOC in view of

(a) Specialized skill set requirements of operating and managing a SOC,

(b) Difficulty in finding experienced staff,

(c) Time consuming and expensive trainings,

(d) Designing of suitable compensation strategies,

(e)  difficulty  of  retaining  staff    due  to  continual  need  for  updated  training,  lack  of

adequate career path options, and overstretching ,

(f) Resource requirements pertaining to other supporting functions such as (i) system

administration

of

systems

facilitating

SOC

operations

such

as

SIEM/dashboard/reporting/workflow/case  management  systems,  etc.,  (ii)  receiving,

integrating  and  using  threat  intelligence,  (iii)  implementing  communication  strategy,

(iv)  Supervision/  management  of  SOC  staff/personnel,  (v)  meeting  compliance

requirements of regulators/laws/regulations

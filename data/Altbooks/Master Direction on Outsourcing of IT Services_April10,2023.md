Madam/Dear Sir,

Master Direction on Outsourcing of Information Technology Services

Regulated  Entities  (REs)  have  been  extensively  leveraging  Information  Technology

(IT) and IT enabled Services (ITeS) to support their business models, products and

services offered to their customers. REs also outsource substantial portion of their IT

activities to third parties, which expose them to various risks.

2.  In  order  to  ensure  effective  management  of  attendant  risks,  the  Statement  on

Developmental  and  Regulatory  Policies  dated  February 10,  2022,  proposed  the

issuance of suitable regulatory guidelines on Outsourcing of IT Services.  Accordingly,

a  draft  Master  Direction  on  Outsourcing  of  IT  Services  was  released  for  public

comments in June 2022.  Based on feedback received, the finalised Reserve Bank of

India (Outsourcing of Information Technology Services) Directions, 2023 are enclosed

herewith.

3.    The  underlying  principle  of  these  Directions  is  to  ensure  that  outsourcing

arrangements  neither  diminish  REs  ability  to  fulfil  its  obligations  to  customers  nor

impede effective supervision by the RBI.

4.  With a view to provide REs adequate time to comply with the requirements, the

enclosed Directions shall come into effect from October 1, 2023.

Yours faithfully,

(T.K.Rajan)
Chief General Manager

(c)  REs  shall  be  responsible  for  the  confidentiality  and  integrity  of  data  and

information  pertaining  to  the  customers  that  is  available  to  the  service

provider.

(d)  Access to data at RE’s location / data centre by service providers shall be

on  need-to-know  basis,  with  appropriate  controls  to  prevent  security

breaches and/or data misuse.

(e)  Public  confidence  and  customer  trust  in  REs  is  a  prerequisite  for  their

stability and reputation. Hence, REs shall seek to ensure the preservation

and protection of the security and confidentiality of customer information in

the  custody  or  possession  of  the  service  provider.  Access  to  customer

information by staff of the service provider shall be on need-to-know basis.

(f)

In the event of multiple service provider relationships where two or more

service  providers  collaborate  to  deliver  an  end-to-end  solution,  the  RE

remains  responsible

for  understanding  and  monitoring

the  control

environment  of  all  service  providers  that  have  access  to  the  RE’s  data,

systems, records or resources.

14

(g)

In  instances  where  service  provider  acts  as  an  outsourcing  agent  for

multiple REs, care shall be taken to build adequate safeguards so that there

is no combining of information, documents, records and assets5.

(h)  The  RE  shall  ensure  that  cyber  incidents  are  reported  to  the  RE  by  the

service provider without undue delay, so that the incident is reported by the

RE to the RBI within 6 hours of detection by the TPSP.

(i)  The  REs  shall  review  and  monitor  the  control  processes  and  security

practices  of  the  service  provider  to  disclose  security  breaches.  The  REs

shall immediately notify RBI in the event of breach of security and leakage

of  confidential  customer  related  information.  In  these  eventualities,  REs

shall adhere to the extant instructions issued by RBI from time to time on

Incident Response and Recovery Management.

(j)  Concentration  Risk:  REs  shall  effectively  assess

the

impact  of

concentration  risk  posed  by  multiple  outsourcings  to  the  same  service

provider  and/or  the  concentration  risk  posed  by  outsourcing  critical  or

material functions to a limited number of service providers.

18.  Business Continuity Plan and Disaster Recovery Plan

a)  REs shall require their service providers to develop and establish a robust

framework  for  documenting,  maintaining  and  testing  Business  Continuity

Plan  (BCP)  and  Disaster  Recovery  Plan  (DRP)  commensurate  with  the

nature and scope of the outsourced activity as per extant instructions issued

by RBI from time to time on BCP/ DR requirements.

b)

In establishing a viable contingency plan, REs shall consider the availability

of alternative service providers or the possibility of bringing the outsourced

activity back in-house in an emergency, and the costs, time and resources

that would be involved.

5 As regards combining of data, it would suffice to comply with the following: A clear separation and isolation of
data (RE and its customer specific data and information) to ensure that only the personnel as authorised by the RE
is able to access data that belongs to them in a multi-tenant environment/ architecture.

15

c)

In order to mitigate the risk of unexpected termination of the outsourcing

agreement  or  insolvency/  liquidation  of  the  service  provider,  REs  shall

retain an appropriate level of control over their IT-outsourcing arrangement

along  with  right  to  intervene,  with  appropriate  measures  to  continue  its

business operations.

d)  REs  shall  ensure  that  service  providers  are  able  to  isolate  the  REs’

information,  documents  and  records  and  other  assets.  This  is  to  ensure

that,  in  adverse  conditions  or  termination  of  the  contract,  all  documents,

record of transactions and information with the service provider and assets

of the RE can be removed from the possession of the service provider, or

deleted, destroyed or rendered unusable.

Chapter – VII

Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities

19.  Monitoring and Control of Outsourced Activities

a)  REs shall have in place a management structure to monitor and control its

Outsourced IT activities. This shall include (as applicable to the scope of

Outsourcing of IT Services) but not limited to monitoring the performance,

uptime of the systems and resources, service availability, adherence to SLA

requirements, incident response mechanism, etc.

b)  RE shall conduct regular audits (as applicable to the scope of Outsourcing

of IT Services) of service providers (including sub-contractors) with regard

to  the  activity  outsourced  by  it.  Such  audits  may  be  conducted  either  by

RE’s internal auditors or external auditors appointed to act on RE’s behalf.

c)  While outsourcing various IT services, more than one RE may be availing

services from the same third-party service provider. In such scenarios, in

lieu of conducting separate audits by individual REs of the common service

provider,  they  may  adopt  pooled  (shared)  audit.  This  allows  the  relevant

REs  to  either  pool  their  audit  resources  or engage  an  independent  third-

party auditor to jointly audit a common service provider. However, in doing

so,  it  shall  be  the  responsibility  of  REs  in  ensuring  that  the  audit

16

requirements related to their respective contract with the service provider

are met effectively.

d)  The audits shall assess the performance of the service provider, adequacy

of  the  risk  management  practices  adopted  by  the  service  provider,

compliance with laws and regulations, etc.  The frequency of the audit shall

be determined based on the nature and extent of risk and impact to the RE

from the outsourcing arrangements. Reports on the monitoring and control

activities shall be reviewed periodically by the Senior Management and in

case of any adverse development, the same shall be put up to the Board

for information.

e)  REs,  depending  upon  the  risk  assessment,  may  also  rely  upon  globally

recognised third-party certifications made available by the service provider

in lieu of conducting  independent audits. However, this shall  not absolve

REs  of  their  responsibility  in  ensuring  assurance  on  the  controls  and

procedures  required  to  safeguard  data  security  (including  availability  of

systems) at the service provider’s end.

f)

The RE shall periodically review the financial and operational condition of

the service provider to assess its ability to continue to meet its Outsourcing

of IT Services obligations. RE shall adopt risk-based approach in defining

the periodicity. Such due diligence reviews shall highlight any deterioration

or  breach  in  performance  standards,  confidentiality,  and  security,  and  in

operational resilience preparedness.

g)

In the event of termination of the outsourcing agreement for any reason in

cases where the service provider deals with the customers of the RE, the

same  shall  be  given  due  publicity  by  the  RE  so  as  to  ensure  that  the

customers stop dealing with the concerned service provider.

h)  REs shall ensure that the service provider grants unrestricted and effective

access  to  a)  data  related  to  the  outsourced  activities;  b)  the  relevant

business premises of the service provider; subject to appropriate security

protocols,  for  the  purpose  of  effective  oversight  use  by  the  REs,  their

auditors,  regulators  and  other  relevant  Competent  Authorities,  as

authorised under law.

17

Chapter – VIII

Outsourcing within a Group / Conglomerate

20.  Outsourcing within a Group / Conglomerate

a)  A RE may outsource any IT activity/ IT enabled service within its business

group/ conglomerate, provided that such an arrangement is backed by the

Board-approved  policy  and  appropriate  service  level  arrangements/

agreements with its group entities are in place.

b)  The selection of a group entity shall be based on objective reasons that are

similar to selection of a third-party, and any conflicts of interest that such an

outsourcing arrangement may entail shall be appropriately dealt with.

c)  REs, at all times, shall maintain an arm's length relationship in dealings with

their group entities. Risk management practices being adopted by the RE

while outsourcing to a group entity shall be identical to those specified for

a non-related party.

Chapter – IX

Cross-Border Outsourcing

21.  Additional requirements for Cross-Border Outsourcing

a)  The  engagement  of  a  service  provider  based  in  a  different  jurisdiction

exposes the RE to country risk. To manage such risk, the RE shall closely

monitor government policies of the jurisdiction in which the service provider

is  based  and  the  political,  social,  economic  and  legal  conditions  on  a

continuous basis, as well as establish sound procedures for mitigating the

country risk. This includes, inter alia, having appropriate contingency and

exit strategies. Further, it shall be ensured that availability of records to the

RE and the RBI will not be affected even in case of liquidation of the service

provider.

b)  The  governing  law  of  the  arrangement  shall  also  be  clearly  specified.  In

principle, arrangements shall only be entered into with parties operating in

jurisdictions upholding confidentiality clauses and agreements.

18

c)  The right of the RE and the RBI to direct and conduct audit or inspection of

the service provider based in a foreign jurisdiction shall be ensured.

d)  The  arrangement  shall  comply  with  all  statutory  requirements  as  well  as

regulations issued by the RBI from time to time.

Chapter – X

Exit Strategy

22.  Exit Strategy

a)  The Outsourcing of IT Services policy shall contain a clear exit strategy with

regard  to  outsourced  IT  activities/  IT  enabled  services,  while  ensuring

business continuity during and after exit. The strategy should include exit

strategy  for  different  scenarios  of  exit  or  termination  of  services  with

stipulation  of  minimum  period  to  execute  such  plans,  as  necessary.  In

documenting  an  exit  strategy,  the  RE  shall,  inter  alia,  identify  alternative

arrangements,  which  may  include  performing  the  activity  by  a  different

service provider or RE itself.

b)  REs  shall  ensure  that  the  agreement  has  necessary  clauses  on  safe

removal/ destruction of data, hardware and all records (digital and physical),

as  applicable.  However,  service  provider  shall  be  legally  obliged  to

cooperate fully with both the RE and new service provider(s) to ensure there

is  a  smooth  transition.    Further,  agreement  shall  ensure  that  the  service

provider is prohibited from erasing, purging, revoking, altering or changing

any  data  during  the  transition  period,  unless  specifically  advised  by  the

regulator/ concerned RE.

19

Appendix – I

Usage of Cloud Computing Services

There are several cloud deployment and service models that have emerged over time.

These are generally based on the extent of technology stack that is proposed to be

adopted  by  the  consuming  entity.  Each  of  these  models6  come  with  corresponding

service, business benefit and risk profiles.

In addition to the Outsourcing of IT Services controls prescribed in these Directions,

REs shall adopt the following requirements for storage, computing and movement of

data in cloud environments:

1. While considering adoption of cloud solution, it is imperative to analyse the business

strategy and goals adopted to the current IT applications footprint and associated

costs7. Cloud adoption ranges from moving only non-business critical workloads to

the cloud to moving critical business applications such as SaaS adoption and the

several  combinations  in-between,  which  should  be  based  on  a  business

technology risk assessment.

2.  In engaging cloud services, REs shall ensure, inter alia, that the Outsourcing of IT

Services policy addresses the entire lifecycle of data, i.e., covering the entire span

of  time  from  generation  of  the  data,  its  entry  into  the  cloud,  till  the  data  is

permanently erased/ deleted. The REs shall ensure that the procedures specified

are consistent with business needs and legal and regulatory requirements.

3.  In adoption of cloud services, REs shall take into account the cloud service specific

factors,  viz.,  multi-tenancy,  multi-location  storing/  processing  of  data,  etc.,  and

attendant risks, while establishing appropriate risk management framework.  Cloud

security is a shared responsibility between the RE and the Cloud Service Provider

6  For example, some cloud service and deployment models are: a) Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS): The service
provides  compute,  storage,  network,  and  other  basic  resources  so  that  the  client  can  develop  and  deploy  their
applications. b) Platform as a Service (PaaS):  The service provides software for building application, middleware,
database, development environment and other tools along with the infrastructure to the client.  c) Software as a
Service (SaaS): Client uses the application(s) provided by the service provider on a cloud infrastructure.  d) Besides
application services, Cloud Service Providers (CSPs) also provide a range of services besides the three common
services viz. Database as a Service, Security as a Service, Storage as a Service and others with varying risk levels.
Deployment Models: cloud services are delivered through the popular models such as Private Cloud, Public Cloud,
Hybrid Cloud, Community Cloud.

7 For example, different heads of cloud related expenses could be application refactoring, integration, consulting,
migration, projected recurring expenditure depending on the workloads, etc.

20

(CSP).    REs  may  refer  to  some  of  the  cloud  security  best  practices8,  for

implementing necessary controls, as per applicability of the shared responsibility

model in the adoption of cloud services.

4. Cloud  Governance:  REs  shall  adopt  and  demonstrate  a  well-established  and

documented  cloud  adoption  policy.  Such  a  policy  should,  inter  alia,  identify  the

activities that can be moved to the cloud, enable and support protection of various

stakeholder interests, ensure compliance with regulatory requirements, including

those  on  privacy,  security,  data  sovereignty,  recoverability  and  data  storage

requirements,  aligned  with  data  classification.  The  policy  should  provide  for

appropriate due diligence to manage and continually monitor the risks associated

with CSPs.

5. Cloud Service Providers (CSP)

Considerations for selection of CSP: REs shall ensure that the selection of the CSP

is  based  on  a  comprehensive  risk  assessment  of  the  CSP.  REs  shall  enter  into  a

contract  only  with  CSPs  subject  to  jurisdictions  that  uphold  enforceability  of

agreements  and  the  rights  available  thereunder  to  REs,  including  those  relating  to

aspects such as data storage, data protection and confidentiality.

6. Cloud Services Management and Security Considerations

a)  Service and Technology Architecture: REs shall ensure that the service and

technology  architecture  supporting  cloud-based  applications

is  built

in

adherence  to  globally  recognised  architecture  principles  and  standards.  REs

shall prefer a technology architecture that provides for secure container-based

data management, where encryption keys and Hardware Security Modules are

under the control of the RE. The architecture should provide for a standard set

of  tools  and  processes  to  manage  containers,  images  and  releases.  Multi-

tenancy  environments  should  be  protected  against  data  integrity  and

confidentiality risks, and against co-mingling of data. The architecture should

be  resilient  and  enable  smooth  recovery  in  case  of  failure  of  any  one  or

21

combination of components across the cloud architecture with minimal impact

on data/ information security.

b)

Identity and Access Management (IAM): IAM shall be agreed upon with the

CSP  and  ensured  for  providing  role-based  access  to  the  cloud  hosted

applications, in respect of user-access and privileged-access. Stringent access

controls, as applicable for an on-premise application, may be established for

identity and access management to cloud-based applications. Segregation of

duties  and  role  conflict  matrix  should  be  implemented  for  all  kinds  of  user-

access and privileged-access roles in the cloud-hosted application irrespective

of  the  cloud  service  model.  Access  provisioning  should  be  governed  by

principles  of  ‘need  to  know’  and  ‘least  privileges’.  In  addition,  multi-factor

authentication should be implemented for access to cloud applications.

c)  Security  Controls:  REs  shall  ensure  that  the  implementation  of  security

controls  in  the  cloud-based  application  achieves  similar  or  higher  degree  of

control objectives than those achieved in/ by an on-premise application. This

includes  ensuring  -  secure  connection  through  appropriate  deployment  of

network  security  resources  and  their  configurations;  appropriate  and  secure

configurations,  monitoring  of  the  cloud  assets  utilised  by  the  RE;  necessary

procedures to authorise changes to cloud applications and related resources.

d)  Robust Monitoring and Surveillance: REs shall accurately define minimum

monitoring  requirements  in  the  cloud  environment.  REs  should  ensure  to

assess the information/ cyber security capability of the cloud service provider,

such that, the

i)  CSP  maintains  an  information  security  policy  framework  commensurate

with its exposures to vulnerabilities and threats;

ii)    CSP  is  able  to  maintain  its  information/  cyber  security  capability  with

respect to changes in vulnerabilities and threats, including those resulting

from changes to information assets or its business environment;

iii)  nature  and  frequency  of  testing  of  controls  by  the  CSP  in  respect  of  the

outsourced  services  is  commensurate  with  the  materiality  of  the  services

being outsourced by the RE and the threat environment; and

22

iv)  CSP has mechanisms in place to assess the sub-contractors with regards

to confidentiality, integrity and availability of the data being shared with the

sub-contractors, where applicable.

e)  Appropriate  integration  of  logs,  events  from  the  CSP  into  the  RE’s  SOC,

wherever applicable and/ or retention of relevant logs in cloud shall be ensured

for incident reporting and handling of incidents relating to services deployed on

the cloud.

f)  The RE’s own efforts in securing its application shall be complemented by the

CSP’s  cyber  resilience  controls.  The  CSP  /  RE  shall  ensure  continuous  and

regular updates of security-related software including upgrades, fixes, patches

and  service  packs  for  protecting  the  application  from  advanced  threats/

malware.

g)  Vulnerability Management: REs shall ensure that CSPs have a well-governed

and  structured  approach  to  manage  threats  and  vulnerabilities  supported  by

requisite industry-specific threat intelligence capabilities.

7. Disaster Recovery & Cyber Resilience

a)  The  RE’s  business  continuity  framework  shall  ensure  that,  in  the  event  of  a

disaster affecting its cloud services or failure of the CSP, the RE can continue

its critical operations with minimal disruption of services while ensuring integrity

and security.

b)  REs  shall  ensure  that  the  CSP  puts  in  place  demonstrative  capabilities  for

preparedness and readiness for cyber resilience as regards cloud services in

use by them. This should be systematically ensured, inter alia, through robust

incident  response  and  recovery  practices  including  conduct  of  Disaster

Recovery  (DR)  drills  at  various  levels  of  cloud  services  including  necessary

stakeholders.

8.  The following points may be evaluated while developing an exit strategy:

a)

the exit strategy and service level stipulations in the SLA shall factor in, inter

alia,

i)  agreed  processes  and  turnaround  times  for  returning  the  RE’s  service

collaterals and data held by the CSP;

23

ii)  data completeness and portability;

iii)  secure purge of RE’s information from the CSP’s environment;

iv)  smooth transition of services; and

v)  unambiguous definition of liabilities, damages, penalties and indemnities.

b)  monitoring the ongoing design of applications and service delivery technology

stack that the exit plans should align with.

c)  contractually  agreed  exit  /  termination  plans  should  specify  how  the  cloud-

hosted service(s) and data will be moved out from the cloud with minimal impact

on continuity of the RE’s business, while maintaining integrity and security.

d)  All records of transactions, customer and operational information, configuration

data should be promptly taken over in a systematic manner from the CSP and

purged at the CSP-end and independent assurance sought before signing off

from the CSP.

9. Audit and Assurance: The audit/ periodic review/ third-party certifications should

cover, as per applicability and cloud usage, inter alia, aspects such as roles and

responsibilities  of  both  RE  and  CSP  in  cloud  governance,  access  and  network

controls,  configurations,  monitoring  mechanism,  data  encryption,  log  review,

change management, incident response, and resilience preparedness and testing,

etc.

24

Appendix – II

Outsourcing of Security Operations Centre

Outsourcing of Security Operations Centre (SOC) operations has the risk of data being

stored and processed at an external location and managed by a third party (Managed

Security Service Provider (MSSP)) to which REs have lesser visibility. To mitigate the

risks, in addition to the controls prescribed in these Directions, REs shall adopt the

following requirements in the case of outsourcing of SOC operations:

a)  unambiguously  identify  the  owner  of  assets  used  in  providing  the  services

(systems, software, source code, processes, concepts, etc.);

b)  ensure  that  the  RE  has  adequate  oversight  and  ownership  over  the  rule

definition,  customisation  and  related  data/  logs,  meta-data  and  analytics

(specific to the RE);

c)  assess  SOC  functioning,  including  all  physical  facilities  involved  in  service

delivery,  such  as  the  SOC  and  areas  where  client  data  is  stored /  processed

periodically;

d)  integrate the outsourced SOC reporting and escalation process with the RE’s

incident response process; and

e)  review the process of handling of the alerts / events.
